<h2>AUTHOR'S PREFACE</h2>


<p>This account is a descriptive statement of
the organization, management, operation,
and efficiency of the public school system of
Norway. The intent has been to consider
only the more vital features, those essentials which
definitely shape the products of educational endeavor.
Many topics of interest have been touched but briefly
while others have been omitted altogether. Some
attention has been given to pointing out good qualities
of the Norwegian schools and to indicating wherein we
might improve our own.</p>

<p>The materials entering into the make-up of this
dissertation were gathered during a summer and
autumn devoted to travel and study in Norway. Much
time was spent in study at the University Library in
Christiania and still more in the visitation of schools.
It was with pleasure that I availed myself of the opportunity
to see the schools in operation. I observed
recitations throughout the entire program of study in
every grade from the kindergarten to the University.
I also visited many special schools and other educational
institutions both public and private. Further than
this, I was benefited by frequent conferences with the
leading educators of the country and by almost constant
associations with schoolmen, patrons, and students.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
These personal investigations enabled me to
become familiar with the spirit and work of the schools,
and they furnish background for a large part of the
content of this treatise. Since no adequate account of
the schools of Norway is in print, the authority for this
work has been gained chiefly from school laws, annual
reports from the Department of Ecclesiastical and
Educational Affairs (chiefly statistical), and the individual
research referred to above.</p>

<p>It was my good fortune to be provided with official
credentials as holder of a Traveling Fellowship for
study in Norway from the State University of Iowa; a
commission to study the school system of Norway
from His Excellency, B. F. Carroll, the Governor of
the State of Iowa; and a letter of introduction to Norway's
educational executives from Hon. Elmer Ellsworth
Brown, at that time Commissioner of Education
for the United States. These credentials had the
effect of intensifying the already superior courtesy and
obliging disposition of the Norwegian officials and
schoolmen, who gave me free access to every facility
for the pursuance of my work within the state and
voluntarily offered their cooperation whenever I might
desire it. Their gracious exemplification of the spirit
of brotherly kindness made my work among them a
constant delight. I desire to express my gratitude to
the Norwegians wherever I traveled for the rare cordiality
characterizing my reception among them and to
acknowledge my obligations to J. K. Qvigstad, <i>chef for
Kirk-og Undervisningsdepartmentet</i>; Knut Johannes
Hougen, <i>byraachef for Undervisningsvaesen</i>; A. H. Raeder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
<i>Undervisningsraadets</i> formand; Johan Andreas
Johnsen, <i>Skoledirektoren i Kristiania stift</i>; Otto Andreas
Anderssen, <i>Bestyrer og forstelaerer i det Paedagogiske
Seminar for Laerere red hoiere Almenskoler</i>, for valuable
suggestions and careful reading and criticism of the
entire work in manuscript; further to Iowa's Board of
Education and the Graduate Faculty of the State
University of Iowa for the appointment which made
possible the investigation; to Professor F. E. Bolton,
who first suggested that I make the study and who has
constantly been to me a wise counsellor and a willing
co-operator; and finally to my wife who, through all,
has been both critic and companion.</p>

</p>

<p>Jeg har med stor fornoielse gjennemlaest Mr. David
A. Andersons fremstilling av Norges Undervisningsvaesen
og fundet den i all vaesentlige ting korrekt,
fuldstaendig og oplysende. Gjennem personlig iagttagelse,
samtale med kompetente maend og studium av
den vigtigste litteratur er det lykkes forfatteren at
danne sig en klar og noiagtig forestilling om de norske
skolers ordning og saeregne arbeidsformer i deres
historiske tilblivelse og nuvaerende vilkaar. Hans
reflektioner og domme vedner om paedagogiske indsight
og uavhaengig opfatning. Det er mulig at han
nu og da er noget tilboielig til at domme vel gunstig
om vore skoleinstitutioners effektivitet og vort folks
interesse og offervillighed for at gjorc denne saa stor
some mulig, men dette for haenge sammen med at han
ser tingene mot en bakgrund av amerikanske forhold,
som han onsker reformeret.</p>

<p>Jeg har ikke havt anledning til at kontrollere i det
enkelte de statistiske opgaver forfatteren meddeler,
men da disse er hentet ut fra officielle kilder tviler jeg
ikke paa at de er rigtige.</p>

<h2>REVIEWER'S PREFACE</h2>

<h3>(Translation)</h3>


<p class="right">
Christiania, February 16, 1912.<br />
</p>

<p>I have, with great pleasure, read through Mr. David
A. Anderson's presentation of Norway's school system
and found it in all essentials correct, complete and
illuminating. Through personal observation, conversation
with competent men and study of the most
important literature, the author has succeeded in getting
a clear and exact view of the Norwegian school
methods and characteristic forms of work in their
historical development and present condition. His
reflections and judgments testify to pedagogical insight
and independence of views. It may be that now and
then he is somewhat inclined to judge too favorably as
to the efficiency of our institutions and the interest of
our people and their readiness to sacrifice in order to
make this efficiency as high as possible, but this may be
due to the fact that he views it against a background of
American conditions, which he desires to improve.</p>

<p>I have not taken occasion to verify in detail the
statistical tables the author includes, but since they
have been gathered from official sources I do not doubt
that they are correct.</p>

<h2>EDITOR'S PREFACE</h2>


<p>The most pressing problems of education
at the present time are those of organization
and administration of educational forces.
Problems of method of instruction though
important are entirely subsidiary, for if all the people
can be aroused to a desire for education and then be
shown ways and means of attaining it the very desire
for education will be the most important factor in
learning.</p>

<p>No means of studying questions of organization and
administration are so valuable as the comparative.
Various studies of education in foreign countries have
been made, but there still exists a need for many more
investigations. Norway has furnished a great many
illustrious statesmen, scientists and literary masters,
and is also a country abounding in men of a high type
of valor, physical prowess, honesty and industry, and
consequently the educational ideals and practices
which prevail there should be worthy of most careful
consideration. Heretofore, only fragmentary accounts
of Norway's educational system have been available
in the English language. At the writer's suggestion,
Mr. Anderson made a trip abroad for the purpose of
studying the system at first hand. His intimate
acquaintance with the language was a prime essential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
in acquiring an understanding through observation
and reading. That he has made an accurate interpretation
is attested by the foreword of one of Norway's
eminent scholars and that he has made an interesting
account will be conceded by all who peruse the pages.
It is hoped that many more studies of a similar nature
will follow in the near future.</p>

<h2>THE SCHOOL SYSTEM OF NORWAY</h2>




<h2><i>Chapter I</i></h2>

<h3>BACKGROUND AND ORGANIZATION</h3>


<h4>I. INTRODUCTION</h4>

<p>The history of mankind in Norway covers a
period of at least five thousand years and
includes a great variety of interesting incidents
and conditions. The accounts of the
earlier ages may be read only in archaeological formations,
while for more recent times, these silent records
are supplemented and enriched by traditions. All
such accounts are of deep interest and significance but
only in a measure reliable. We have no really authentic
information regarding Norway's political history
until the reign of Harald the Fair Haired (860-930).
We do know, however, that, previous to his establishment
of the sovereign state of Norway in 872, the
people had known only the rule of numerous petty,
warring earls and kings. Besides this, the entire
country had been subjected to the devastations of the
vikings. These sea robbers were the terror of all the
coast countries in western Europe and the British Isles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
until about the year 900 when sea robbery at home
was abolished, and the Norsemen became colonizers,
migrating to surrounding islands, the west and south
of Europe, and probably America. Now when piracy
began to decline the people rose to a higher plane of
living, and the prosperity attained through peace and
industry was found to be the more desirable. A long
succession of kings, some good and some evil, ruled the
land. Paganism was gradually overcome, and about
the year 1,000 Christianity was established.</p>

<p>From this time on, for several centuries, the country
experienced only moderate visible progress though
large gains were made in potential powers. In 1381,
Norway entered into a union with Denmark and remained
in large measure subject to her power until
1814. This period of more than four hundred years
was a season of little good and of great hardships to
the people. Their development received little attention,
the resources of the country and the cause of
education were neglected, and the masses were not
recognized in a way that would tend to their enlightenment
and progress. The entire nation suffered from
international difficulties as well as from oppression at
home. Conditions remained unimproved and the
latent powers of the people, which had been accumulating
for generations, found no adequate means for expression.</p>

<p>When in 1814 the treaty of Kiel, sanctioned by the
European powers, forced Norway into an unwilling
union with Sweden, the Norwegians revolted; and, in
their attempt to liberate themselves, adopted a constitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
for their government.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Their revolt created
ill feelings on the part of the Swedes while the demands
for complete sovereignty by Sweden were resented by
the Norwegians. The adoption of this constitution by
the people of Norway and their standing so tenaciously
for its recognition are manifestations of the spirit which
had been developing among them for centuries. They
believed that they were being imposed upon and stood
firm for their rights. They had felt the crushing hand
of foreign rule, they had observed the benefits of independence,
they had developed confidence in their own
powers, and now they were converted to the idea that
the time for home rule was upon them. Civil liberty
was their dream. State rights came to be demanded.
Their time to act in a decisive manner had come. The
people had grown into a nation deserving and in need of
larger powers, and their best advancement was in great
measure dependent upon the exercise of these powers.
Conditions then justified their demands and Sweden,
appreciating the situation, yielded, acknowledged the
independence of Norway, and agreed to govern in
accordance with the newly adopted constitution. On
the other hand, Norway acceded to the demands of
Sweden in accepting the King of Sweden as theirs also.</p>

<p>Now for nearly one hundred years this union was
maintained. Comparative peace and prosperity prevailed
and the outlook seemed favorable for both
nations. Sweden profited because of the new relations,
and Norway gained in strength and power through her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
experience in individual initiative and governmental
duties generally. While the relations between the two
countries were in the main friendly, on various occasions
Norway felt that her rights were not always respected.
The people craved larger privileges, more recognition
among the nations of the world, and the exercise of
greater authority. The functioning of capacities that
had long lain dormant revealed to her the powers that
were still latent. Norway became eager for absolute
independence and these feelings rose to larger and
larger proportions until desires became demands. All
the people were ready and offered their services, their
fortunes (whether large or scant), and their lives in the
cause of freedom. Finally, formally, and without
bloodshed, the bonds uniting the two countries were
severed in 1905 and Norway became an independent
nation.</p>

<p>Having briefly sketched the history of the country
let us now turn our attention to its geography. Norway,
as we all know, lies in the northwestern part of
Europe, and measures over one thousand one hundred
miles from north to south and from two hundred to
nearly five hundred miles from east to west. Politically
it is divided into eighteen counties (<i>Amter</i>) and
the cities of Christiania and Bergen. These counties
are subdivided into six hundred sixty-six townships
or communes (<i>Kommuner</i>) which are again
divided into school districts or circles (<i>Kredser</i>) numbering
in all five thousand nine hundred seventy.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The area is approximately one hundred and twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
thousand square miles. Nearly all of it is made up
of mountains which have no regularity in distribution,
a large portion of them being merely heaps of barren
rock thrown up in conglomerate masses. The valleys
are as numerous and irregular as the mountains. In
them are lakes, rivers, and waterfalls, their waters pure
and clear as crystal. The lakes differ greatly in outline
and size. The rivers in their windings dash furiously
through precipitous, rugged, rocky channels, or
glide murmuringly through quiet valleys until they
reach the fjords which appear like huge arms of the sea,
reaching deep into the earth and extending far inland.
The waterfalls vary from mere threads tinkling into
tiny pools to great torrents gushing over dizzy precipices.
Viewed in combination these features present
an infinite variety of exquisitely beautiful scenes.</p>

<p>The climate of Norway is greatly diversified owing
to the wide range in latitude and the influence of the
Gulf stream. In the northern part and on the highest
mountains there are vast fields of snow during the
entire year, while in some of the sheltered portions
along the western coast, the climate is well adapted to
the cultivation of some of the tropical plants. It is,
of course, essential that all plants that are cultivated
be of rapid growth and of quick maturity, since their
seasons are quite short. The atmospheric conditions
are excelled nowhere. Few locations on the earth
enjoy such freshness or provide so much mental and
physical invigoration. Just the joy of living is more
than recompense for all one's expense and trouble in
going for a season into this summer home or nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>Being situated so far to the north the days of summer
are very long while those of winter are extremely
short. This is noticeable even in the southern part of
the country, and as one goes farther north it is more
and more striking until upon reaching the arctic circle
the summer traveler has the unique experience of seeing
the sun at midnight. It is visible for weeks or
months at a time, according to whether one is near the
circle or farther toward the pole. For corresponding
periods during the winter seasons the sun does not appear
at all. It should not be inferred that these sunless
days are intensely dark and gloomy. On the contrary,
they, as well as the midnight sun, have fascinations
peculiar to themselves and are of deep interest,
especially to the novice in that latitude. The glitter
of the stars, the glow of the moon, and the palpitating
brilliance of the northern lights, combine with the
light reflected from the vast snow fields and compensate
in part for the absence of the direct rays from the sun.</p>

<p>The industries and occupations of the Norwegians
are dependent in large measure upon environing conditions.
Nearly one-fourth of the country is covered
with a heavy growth of timber; hence, lumbering affords
a large part of the most profitable employment. Much
of the mountainous land can be used only for pasturage
and, as a result, dairying claims considerable attention.
Only a very small portion of the area (about four per
cent) is suitable for agriculture and owing to this
limitation of opportunity, comparatively few of the
people are farmers. Their numerous fisheries supply
cargoes, and train loads of fresh and cured fish to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
markets of the world. Fishing is, in fact, one of the
most important industries, and a large percentage of
the wage earners of the country engage in it. Since
the bulk of their travel and transportation is by water,
a great many become sailors. A certain amount of
manufacturing also is done, and this provides another
means of earning a livelihood. The fact that nearly
all of the people are gathered into cities, towns, and
settlements along the coast, is explained by a consideration
of the activities and conditions herein set
forth.</p>

<p>The people of Norway are large of stature, vigorous,
and alert in mind and body. They have ever been undaunted
in their efforts to overcome the great, natural
barriers to progress and to secure what they believed
would be for their well-being. Toiling patiently and
persistently, suffering hardships on land and perils at
sea, they have developed the well-known characteristics
of their sturdy race. The long, rigorous winters taught
the people to provide amply for the needs of the future,
and they learned also the economy of making every endeavor
count for permanency. It has been and is
still their aim and intent to so direct their efforts that
their citizens may experience and enjoy not only in the
present the best conditions made possible by the world's
highest attainments, but that later generations also
may reap valuable benefits therefrom. They realize
that it is easily possible for today's provisions to supply
the best for the present, and at the same time to bless
tomorrow and the next day and all the coming years.</p>

<p>The Norwegians are as democratic in mind and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
disposition as any people of the earth. They demand
that the masses shall receive whatever benefit may
come from prosperity at home, from their relations
with other nations, or from legislation. They advocate
further that right now is the time to increase opportunities,
to multiply privileges, to raise standards of
living, and to insure through conservative action a
substantial basis on which the coming generations may
safely build. In accord with their aims and ideals
they study the questions of education, labor and capital,
and many others of vital interest to the people. They
seek out sources, eliminating the undesirable and cultivating
those of favorable growth and fruitage. Recognizing
their own resourcefulness and ability, the
Norsemen strive to gain for themselves and for their
descendants material prosperity and true culture.
To these ends they foster educational advantages for
all, the development of the arts and sciences, and the
elevation of labor.</p>

<p>Educationally, they have ever been desirous of providing
the best possible advantages. During the latter
part of the nineteenth century and the few years of the
present one, they have been in a position to put into
execution a number of advance ideas which they have
done without hesitation. Being observant of what
other nations provide they have been ready to select
from various sources whatever good they found, to
eliminate any undesirable features which revealed
themselves, and to strengthen the weaker points.
Though they have been forced by conditions to assume
and maintain a conservative attitude toward every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
new project or attempt at reform, they have been also
too democratic to permit tradition or precedent to
bind them down or to hinder them in making changes
in their school system, which they were convinced
by experience or study would be for their good. In
harmony with this they have been eager to make revisions
where necessary; to introduce new features,
which had been tested at home or abroad and found
successful; and to cast aside relics of the past, unnecessary
phases of work, and those things which might be
supplanted by materials of superior advantage or
value to the people served. They have become
habituated to examining the new from every conceivable
viewpoint, to finding its foundations, to testing
its values, and to weighing its effects. When a thing
has been thoroughly studied it is accepted or rejected
according to whether it is adjudged desirable or undesirable
for their use under existing conditions. In
their effort to answer the demands of the people and to
supply their needs, schools have been established according
to local requirements. That is to say, every
community enjoys school advantages, and every child
in the entire state is privileged to receive instruction
for a certain number of weeks each year at the expense
of the state. All children are required to attend the
schools of the state at least twelve weeks each year for
seven years, or to receive instruction elsewhere which
is equivalent to the amount required. In the more
populous places higher schools also are provided for
those who desire to take advantage of the opportunities
afforded in them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>


<h4>II. DIFFERENTIATION OF SCHOOLS.</h4>

<p>It was early recognized by the Norwegians that
through the means of education, better than any other
way, they could develop a people qualified to pursue
the arts, to cultivate the sciences, to appreciate and enjoy
the highest culture, and to maintain and develop
their noblest ideals of citizenship and richest conceptions
of statehood. Having these objects in mind
they endeavored to establish schools of instruction
and training along every legitimate line. Beginning
with the most essential they worked unceasingly, providing
additional worthy kinds of instruction as rapidly
as possible, until their efforts resulted in their present
school system.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important feature of their work
was the establishment of primary schools, which furnish
general education. These schools provide seven
years of elementary instruction for children between
the ages of seven and fourteen years, and are literally
the people's schools (<i>Folkeskoler</i>). The law requires
that pupils must be regular in attendance, and that
parents, who fail to have their children in school in
harmony with the provisions of the law, be fined according
to the seriousness and extent of the offense.
It is further provided that these schools shall be in
operation for at least twelve weeks in the year, and that
this time may be extended according to local demands
or needs. As a matter of fact, nearly all of them in
the cities and many of them in the country operate
forty weeks per year. As a consequence of liberal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
provisions and enforced regulations, Norway has
achieved an eminent place educationally among the
nations of the world.</p>

<p>In the rural sections primary schools are held in
comfortable, well equipped, and conveniently located
schoolhouses and are taught by competent teachers
who live near by in homes provided for them. In a
few remote, rugged sections of the country, where
children are few and scattering or where locations
accessible to all cannot be found, they have no fixed
schools, but instead what are termed ambulatory
schools (<i>Omgangskoler</i>). There are no schoolhouses
in these districts but the officials designate certain
houses<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> as the places where children go at stated times
to receive instruction. The teacher meets the children
of the neighborhood in a given home and teaches them
for a specified time, passes to the next designated place,
and continues until his rounds are completed. Formerly,
a very large number of these schools existed, but
as roadways were extended or improved and the people
became able to erect and maintain schoolhouses,
the demand for ambulatory schools decreased until
now nearly all of them are supplanted by fixed schools.
In 1837, ninety-two per cent of the children attending
school in the country were taught in ambulatory schools,
while in 1907 this was the case with less than one per
cent of them.</p>

<p>In all the cities and towns excellent educational advantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
are provided. Usually their school year consists
of forty weeks of six days each. Every provision
is made for the welfare of the children; excellent instructors
are secured, and the equipment for teaching
purposes is of the best procurable. Furthermore, no
pains are spared in guarding the children from physical
discomfort and immoral conditions or associations.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the development of the elementary
schools secondary education moved along advance
lines. In 1814, when Norway became an independent
state there were but four of the higher classical (<i>laerde</i>)
schools within her borders. These were the historic
cathedral schools (<i>Kathedralskoler</i>) which had been
established for centuries. As time passed, other secondary
schools were organized. Higher education was reorganized
in 1869 and again in 1896, when by act of the
Storthing secondary education was made to include
the middle school and the gymnasium. The enactment
defines these schools and states their aim as follows:
"The middle school is a school for children,
which, in union with the primary school, gives its pupils
a complete, thorough, general education, adapted
to the receptivity of childhood. The gymnasium is a
school for young people, which on the foundation of the
middle school, leads on to a complete, higher, general
education, which may also serve as a basis for scientific
studies. Both middle school and gymnasium shall
contribute to the religions and moral training of the
pupils, and it should also be their common aim to develop
the pupils both mentally and physically into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
competent young people."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The act requires that
the middle school shall be no longer than four years,
and that the gymnasial courses shall be of three years'
duration.</p>

<p>The gymnasia of Norway take up the work where
the middle schools leave off, and provide three years of
instruction which concludes with the <i>examen artium</i>.
The passing of this examination entitles the individual
to become a student in the university. Previous to
the time of entering the gymnasium the subjects of
instruction are uniform for all; here they branch into
two or three lines, any one of which may be selected by
the pupil and followed to its completion. The main
divisions of the work are represented in the names of
the courses&mdash;the <i>Real</i> and the Linguistic-Historical.
The latter of these is again divided in some schools,
one of its two lines including Latin. The <i>Real</i> course
of instruction is largely scientific while the Linguistic-Historical,
true to its name, embodies a large amount
of language and history. In case the course including
Latin is offered, Latin replaces some of the work in
modern languages and history.</p>

<p>The middle school, then, is the second step in the
educational ladder and builds upon the work previously
done in the primary school. No middle school is
privileged to include work lower down than the sixth
grade. In other words, the primary schools are the
only ones which are authorized to present the work of
the first five grades or years of school instruction.
The courses of study are so arranged that a child may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
pass from the primary school after completing the
fifth grade and enter directly upon the studies in the
regular four year course of the middle school. On the
other hand a pupil may continue in the primary school
until its completion&mdash;seven years&mdash;and then enter a
middle school and finish its requirements in three years.
While nearly all middle schools present a four year
course there are a few which offer only three years of
instruction. In order to enter these latter schools the
child must have finished the seven years of instruction
in the primary schools. Middle schools are under the
inspection of state officials and a uniform standard of
work is required of all of them. The middle school
examination which marks the completion of the middle
school course is exactly the same for all pupils in the
state. In any given year all who take the examinations
write on exactly the same questions on a specified
hour of a certain day.</p>

<p>The Royal Frederik University, established by King
Frederik in 1811, furnishes the summit of educational
endeavor. Its five faculties&mdash;(1) theology, (2) law,
(3) medicine, (4) mathematics and science, and (5)
history and philosophy&mdash;represent the best products
of the country and maintain standards of efficiency
paralleling the achievements of the day. Besides
the five faculties already mentioned there are (1) The
Practical Theological Seminary for the training of
ministers and (2) The Pedagogical Seminary (affiliated)
for special training of teachers. Through the endeavors
of the faculties and seminaries enumerated, the necessary
professions, scientific organizations, and philosophic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
societies are supplied with men of eminent qualifications.
The state also is supplied from the same source
with individuals capable of attending to the affairs of
state in a dignified and competent manner.</p>

<p>To aid prospective teachers and to maintain high
professional standards, Norway early established a
Teachers' Seminary in each of its six dioceses (<i>Stifter</i>).
Having made this ample provision for the training of
teachers, they were in a position to require a certain
amount of professional preparation of all candidates
for appointment to teaching positions. Adherence to
this laudable principle has saved the state from an overflow
of incompetent instructors. While requirements
were very low for a long time, the increasing supply of
qualified candidates for positions warranted successive
shiftings of them to higher and higher standards. At
present, the teachers of Norway, as a body, rank among
the best in educational equipment, professional training,
and morality.</p>

<p>Technical, agricultural, military, and naval schools
have been established in order to keep pace with the
world's developments along these lines. The technical
school in Trondhjem opened in 1910, sets the requirements
for admission as high as those at the university.
Its work promises to be of unquestioned quality and
its prospects are very bright. The students at this
school come chiefly from the scientific course offered
in the gymnasia or from the several preparatory technical
schools of Norway. There are many of these
lower technical schools doing excellent work and some
of them are modeled after American schools. The work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
of the agricultural college and of the military and naval
schools is more or less technical along their respective
lines and meets certain requirements not elsewhere
provided for. When one notes the variety of schools
maintained by the Norwegian state, it is evident that
it is the intent to provide for its citizens a very wide
range of educational advantages, and at the same time
to develop the capacities of young people until they are
able to perform the offices of state and nation.</p>


<h4>III. DISTRIBUTION OF SCHOOLS AND PUPILS</h4>

<p>The laws of Norway are specific in their requirements
regarding education, and the people are at hand
to provide the essential means for carrying out the demands.
It is required that in each city or district in
the entire realm there shall be the necessary number of
schools to provide instruction for all children of school
age. This is in answer to the law which makes a requirement
of a certain minimum amount of education
of all such children.</p>

<p>The primary schools are distributed in the cities,
villages, and rural communes to suit the convenience
of pupils attending. Other and higher schools are
provided where most needed. As is true everywhere
the bulk of work is done in the primary schools. Rural
and city schools have their own laws and government,
and are admirably adapted to the needs of their respective
constituencies. As would be expected, the rural
schools and the pupils attending them far outnumber
those in the cities and towns. There are in the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
five thousand, nine hundred and seventy schools
attended by two hundred seventy-five thousand, one
hundred and fifty-five pupils, while there are but
sixty-one city school systems having an enrollment of
ninety thousand, one hundred and twenty-nine pupils.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
It is seen that there are about three times as many
pupils in the rural primary schools as are found in the
city primary schools. The distribution and care of the
city school pupils are, however, much larger tasks
than providing for those in the rural sections. In
order to show conditions in a given city we insert Table
I which indicates the number of classes and pupils
in the several grades in the nineteen primary schools
of Christiania, and also gives the totals for the entire
city. Boys and girls attend the same school, but in this
particular city they are generally separated into different
rooms where they are taught by themselves.
The schools are co-educational but not generally coinstructional.
As the table will show, some of them are

<p>In addition to the special features in this table, to
which we have already called attention, it may be observed
that the total number of boys', girls', and co-educational
classes; the total number of boys and of
girls in attendance at each school; and the average
number of pupils per class in each school are also included.</p>

<p>The law limits the number of pupils in a class to
thirty-five, except temporarily or in case of stringency
in financial conditions, and in no case must there be
more than forty.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> It is seen in the table that the
average is above thirty-five in all but one school, but
it has been exceedingly difficult in the rapidly growing
city of Christiania to avoid congestion in the schools.
In only one of the nineteen schools does the general
average come within the rule. If they plead economic
stringency then the averages of all fall within the limits.</p>

<p>Now a large percentage of children continue their
education after the completion of the elementary
course. In 1907, there were nine thousand, eight hundred
and ninety-five pupils in the accredited middle
schools,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and one thousand, five hundred and ninety-three
in the gymnasia. About eighteen thousand
others attended non-accredited secondary schools and
those of still lower standards&mdash;evening schools, continuation
schools, and various preparatory schools.
Approximately two thousand were in technical schools<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
and about one thousand in teachers' seminaries.
Nearly every town of any considerable consequence has
a middle school where pupils from the town and surrounding
territory may receive its benefits. The
larger cities have, in addition to a liberal supply of
middle schools, one or more gymnasia, according to
their size. The gymnasia draw from a wider territory
than do the middle schools because they are fewer and
farther apart.</p>

<p>In addition to the six teachers' seminaries maintained
by the state, there are four private ones&mdash;ten in
all. Table II indicates the aggregate attendance
at these institutions and the number of those who
passed the advanced examinations during the years
designated.</p>

<p>The university, of course, draws its students from all
over the State. It has an attendance of one thousand,
three hundred or more, about five hundred and fifty
of whom are annually enrolled direct from the gymnasia.
These students represent the best products
of the country and generally they work with earnestness
and zeal.</p>

<p>Private schools have played an important role in
Norway. They have had a long and interesting history.
A number of them do part or all of the work
represented by the state primary and secondary schools
and teachers' seminaries. Most of them are located
in the larger cities and receive recognition and patronage
from some of the best homes in the land. Their influence
upon education generally has been wholesome.
The valuable and attractive features introduced by
them have operated like spurs on those under state
direction. The cooperative activity which has characterized
the relationship between the two kinds of
schools has resulted in the betterment of both and in
the rapid advancement of educational ideals and activities
throughout the state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>There are, of course, some fundamental differences
existing between them. The private schools charge
a regular tuition in every grade of primary and secondary
work. The state primary schools are free and
the tuition in its secondary schools is less than that
charged in the private schools. It is self-evident that
private schools are dependent upon tuition receipts
for both running expenses and profits, while the state
and communal schools are supported largely by public
taxation.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Paralleling so nearly the work of the state
schools, yet being more expensive, the private schools
have been under the necessity of offering certain inducements
in order to secure pupils. They have been
made attractive in location, in buildings, in equipment,
in the personnel of their faculties, and in other ways,
and their efforts have been richly rewarded as a rule.</p>

<p>All classes of schools are subject to state regulations
and inspection. Certain definite requirements must
be met before a private school may even begin to operate,
and still higher standards must be maintained in
order for the work to be accredited by the state. Standards
of excellence are naturally set by state schools and
the requirements fixed by the state inhibit the starting
of inferior schools under the pretense of offering something
"just as good." During recent years some of
the private schools&mdash;those well-known and respected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
because of the nature of work and high standards of
excellence maintained&mdash;have been given special recognition
by the state, and a few of them receive annuities.
When advancement in nature or improvement in quality
of school work is rewarded by increase in patronage
from the state, zest is furnished in the contest for first
recognition.</p>

<p>Though the history of the rise, development and influence
of the private schools of Norway, together with
a discussion of their present status and worth, might
furnish an interesting chapter, it becomes necessary
to let this slight mention suffice and to confine this
work to a treatise of the schools instituted and directed
by the state. It may be added, however, that the work
of the accredited private schools equals in quality and
receives the same recognition as that done in state
schools. For example, all graduates from the private
gymnasia pass the same examinations for <i>artium</i> as
those who complete the work of the state gymnasia
and enter the university on exactly the same footing.</p>


<h4>IV. PUPILS</h4>

<p>The compulsory school laws which operate in Norway
determine the age (seven years) at which children
shall enter school and the regularity of their attendance.
With this in mind, it is readily understood that as a rule
each class marches steadily forward, one grade each
year, until the completion of the school life. As a consequence
there is but little variation in the ages of pupils
doing the work of any certain grade, and the proportion
of pupils of normal age in the several grades is very
large. In order to illustrate definitely, a concrete
situation is presented in Table III, which shows the
exact conditions existing at a certain time in one of their
representative cities.</p>

<p>This table speaks for itself and needs no explanation.
It is worthy of note, however, that in comparatively
few instances do the ages vary more than two or three
years, and that six years is the widest difference in age
to be found among all the pupils of any given grade of
work. Furthermore, we call attention to the fact that
those above normal age in no year aggregated as much
as ten per cent of the entire number in attendance.
10.1 per cent represents the entire number outside
the normal age&mdash;those above plus those below&mdash;for
the year 1908. During the three former years the
percentage was still smaller. The reduction in numbers
of pupils in the sixth and seventh grades is due in
large part to the fact that so many pass from the fifth
grade into the middle school.</p>

<p>The same conditions of uniformity exist in the secondary
schools. Having entered at the age of seven
and having spent five or more years in the primary
school, the pupils upon entrance to the middle school
are generally twelve or more years old. In some middle
schools the average age of those entering will at times
be less than twelve years. This latter condition is
usually due to some local situation or rule regarding
age at entrance upon school work. In order to follow
the age question to nearer its limits we will present
Table IV.</p>

<p>Attention is called to the step from the last year in
the middle school to the first year in the gymnasium.
In several instances there is considerably less than a
year of difference in age. This is but another illustration
of the tendencies of the sifting that goes on in the
natural process of selecting the fittest. Those of keenest
intellect are the ones who reach a specific requirement
in least time and then proceed in the pursuit of
advance education. The ones sifted out are more generally
those whose advance has been more difficult, or
those who have lagged behind others of their own age.
The absence of these tends to lower the average age
in the succeeding grade. Similar conditions in emphasized
form are in evidence when we study the ages
of those who enter the university from year to year.
While the ages of those just entering the third and final
year of the gymnasium are on the average more than
eighteen, the ones who enter the university the following
year in September average nineteen years of age or
a little less.</p>

<p>In addition to the tables showing the ages of pupils
throughout the several grades of preparatory and secondary
education, the following one is inserted to show
the average age of those in attendance at four of the
teachers' seminaries. The advance in age with advance
of grade is not as regular here as in the other
schools.</p>

<p class="center">[Note A: Age in years and months.]</p>

<p>There is not as close correspondence between age
or grade and scholarship in the seminaries as we find
in the other schools. The greater variation is due to
several causes, among them are the following: (1)
The law requires that a teacher must be at least twenty
years of age.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> (2) The previous education of those
in attendance varies greatly. Many are desirous of
getting as thorough and complete preparation as their
circumstances admit, while others are seemingly anxious
to enter on the lowest standard admissible. (3)
Teachers who are eager to improve their qualifications
frequently return to the seminary after a few years of
teaching experience in order to complete the course and
prepare for the better class of positions.</p>

<p>Comparisons between the educational equipment of
the American youth and that of his Norwegian cousin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
at any given age are exceedingly difficult to make. We
have not yet established any specific units or norms
by which education may be measured. We can make
neither definite nor satisfactory quantitative or qualitative
measurements of accomplishment. However, a
careful analysis of the respective courses of study, the
qualification of teachers, and plans of work, supported
by the testimony of those who have been teachers in
both countries, seems to warrant the statement that
the completion of the gymnasial course of study in
Norway is comparable to the completion of the sophomore
year of work in our American colleges and universities.
The average age of students is about the
same in both instances.</p>

<p>The American children spend a less portion of the
year in school than do the children in Norway. While
in our schools we generally have but thirty-six weeks of
five days each in a year, inclusive of all regular and special
holidays, the schools of Norway are in operation
forty weeks of six days each, exclusive of holidays.
Leaving out any consideration of holidays, the American
school year usually amounts to one hundred eighty
days, while in Norway they have two hundred and forty
days of school. In other words, eight years of primary
school and four years of high school in America represent
only three-fourths as many days of instruction and
study as are included in five years of primary school,
four years of middle school, and three years of gymnasium
in Norway. That is to say, to provide the same
number of days of instruction it would take sixteen
school years in America to equal twelve in Norway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>The specialization which characterizes the work of
the students upon entrance to the Norwegian university
brings their study within much narrower limits than
that of our ordinary juniors in college. Their general
cultural education concludes with the taking of <i>artium</i>
while ours usually continues throughout the liberal
arts course in college or until the degree of Bachelor of
Arts has been received. A certain amount of specialization
is common among our students during the
later years of their college education, but it covers a
wider range than in Norway and the greater portion of
it is reserved for post graduate courses. In Norway
the professional studies are taken up without any preliminaries
immediately upon entrance to the university.
In the better professional schools of America, one, two,
or three years of collegiate work is required as a preparation
for entrance.</p>


<h4>I. ORGANIZATION&mdash;RELATION TO STATE, COMMUNE, AND CITY</h4>

<p>The highest educational authority of Norway is
vested in the Department of Ecclesiastical and Educational
Affairs (<i>Kirke-og Undervisnings-Departmentet</i>),
and the chief functionary in this department of government
is a member of the King's cabinet (<i>Statsraad</i>).
The work of the department is separated into two divisions,
one of which supervises the ecclesiastical activities
and the other the educational work of the country.
This latter division is again separated into two
bureaus, one having charge of primary education and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the other being in control of secondary educational
affairs. These bureaus perform the functions usually
devolving upon such offices, the work being largely
clerical. In addition there are the diocesan directors
(<i>Stift Direktorer</i>) bearing the immediate responsibilities
in primary education, and a state educational commission
(<i>Undervisningsraad</i>) having large authority in
secondary education.</p>

<p>Next to the department itself the school directors
have authority over primary education. In fact the
director has all but complete control in his territory
even though the department is recognized as having
the higher authority or powers. The King's cabinet
appoints seven directors for the six dioceses into which
the state is divided; two for the most northern, because
of its greater extent, and one for each of the other five.
The directors are paid by the state and are amenable
only to the state, hence they exercise their powers
in an endeavor to effect the best possible results educationally
without fear or favor of local influences.
They act independently in their respective territories
and do not constitute a committee in any sense whatever.</p>

<p>The commission having chief oversight of secondary
education consists of seven men appointed by the
King's cabinet. They are chosen because of their
efficiency in educational affairs without regard to the
part of the country to which they belong.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> They work
always as a committee, and as experts serve the state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
for the general welfare of secondary education. The
many privileges and duties exercised by this commission
may be grouped together under the heads of inspection
and supervision of secondary schools, and arrangements
for having examinations. Several of the
men constituting this commission are at the same time
rectors of leading secondary schools in the country.
In fact they are chosen because of their familiarity with
and expertness in just such kind of work. When it
becomes necessary to seek advice in hygienic questions
a physician of recognized ability is added to the commission.
His judgment and instruction are respected
and adhered to very closely.</p>

<p>The rural communes are divided into school districts
or circles (<i>Skolekredser</i>). Each district supports and
maintains a primary school with at least two divisions&mdash;an
infant school (<i>Smaaskole</i>) for children from seven
to ten years of age, and a higher one designed for children
from ten to fourteen years of age. In districts
where distances are great or roadways difficult, two or
more infant schools are provided.</p>

<p>Companies operating one or more manufacturing
establishments or industrial concerns, and generally
employing thirty or more laborers, are required to
provide a primary school for the children of the men in
their employ. When once started these schools are to
be kept up unless the number of the employed is reduced
below twenty. In case there are other children
who desire to attend such school, they shall have the
right to do so providing it does not interfere with the
instruction of those for whom the school was established.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
In return for this the school treasury receives
from the communal treasury a yearly amount proportioned
to the total cost for all pupils in the school.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>While the law requires that instruction shall be provided
six days in the week for at least twelve weeks each
year, it also grants to the communes the privilege of
extending the time to fifteen weeks.[B] It further provides
the right to maintain six weeks additional, voluntary
instruction each year.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> These privileges are
generally taken advantage of by both communes and
pupils. The communes desire the extension of time
for school, and the pupils are very glad of the opportunity
to attend the extra time, even though their presence
is not compulsory. In fact the compulsory education
law has been so rigidly enforced for so long a time
that regular attendance has become habitual, and the
exact provisions and requirements of the law are rarely
thought of by the pupils. There is, in reality, no law
requiring children to attend the schools provided by
the state, but a certain amount of education is obligatory.
It is mandatory that schools be maintained in
all of the districts, but individual children may receive
their instruction in private schools if they choose, so
long as educational requirements are met from year to
year. Pupils who belong to the schools are required
to be in attendance regularly, and children who receive
instruction elsewhere than in the state schools must
meet the requirements calculated to bring them to a
certain educational standard by the time they are fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
years of age. Failure in this subjects parents,
guardians, and those providing schools for children of
laborers in their employ to fine or imprisonment.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The work in the infant school includes or amounts
to thirty lessons per week while in the higher one there
are thirty-six lessons. Accordingly, the pupils in the
lower grades receive a minimum of three hundred sixty
lessons a year, and this number may be increased to
four hundred fifty or six hundred thirty. In the higher
grades they have at least four hundred thirty-two lessons
a year, and if the time is extended they have five
hundred forty or seven hundred fifty-six lessons a year.</p>

<p>Each rural commune has its own school board
(<i>Skolestyret</i>) consisting of a priest; the chairman of the
municipal council; one or two teachers<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> chosen by the
body of teachers; as many other members (men or
women) as the communal council deems it advisable to
select; and the rectors of higher schools, if there be any,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
under the supervision and inspection of the school
board.</p>

<p>In the towns and cities the school board consists of
at least one priest<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>; a member of the city's executive
council;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> as many other members chosen for three years
as the municipal council deems it advisable to select,
at least half of whom must be chosen from among parents
who at the time of election have children in the
city primary schools; one or two teachers;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and, wherever
the school board controls higher schools, the rectors
of such schools.</p>

<p>The members of the school board select their own
chairman and act together as a committee or board.
Among its more important duties are appointment of
teachers and special committees, provision of course of
study with specific instructions regarding its presentation,
and the estimation of sums of money necessary to
meet demands in the maintenance of the schools for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
year. This estimate of expenses is sent by the board
each year to the communal council which has charge of
the dispensing of finances for the commune.</p>

<p>The course of study, including the plan of instruction
and directions regarding the supervision of the schools as
given by the board, is minutely detailed and specifically
stated. It includes a list of studies to be pursued, the
manner and order of their presentation, and the number
of hours per week to be devoted to each subject;
an outline of arrangements for entrance, promotion,
and leaving examinations, with provisions for exemption
therefrom wherever such is deemed advisable; all
necessary arrangements for vacations; and other
matters considered essential in the maintenance and
carrying on of a school.</p>

<p>For each primary school, or for the several schools,
using the same building, the board appoints a committee
of inspection (<i>Tilsynsutvalg</i>). This committee
consists of a member of the school board (chosen by the
board), who is chairman of the committee, and three
other members. These latter members are chosen in
the city by the parents of children attending the school,
and in the rural districts by such parents and other
taxpayers. A priest appointed by church authority
is added to committees serving town or city schools.</p>

<p>This committee of inspection exercises constant oversight
of the school, keeping the board informed with
reference to all matters requiring attention by that
body. By the consent of the communal council this
committee may have an amount provided from the
school funds for its use in carrying out its work. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
inspection is with special reference to the physical and
moral well-being of those connected with the institution.
Among the special objects of its endeavors may
be enumerated the solving of all hygienic questions,
regular attendance, good discipline, and proper moral
conduct. The committee must also see to it that children
of school age, not in attendance at the state primary
schools, receive instruction in such quantity and
of such quality as to meet all state requirements. In
general it is an outstretched arm of the school board,
feeling after the betterment of the common schools in
every possible direction.</p>

<p>Another committee (called the school committee&mdash;<i>Skoleraad</i>)
is appointed by the school board for each of
the primary schools in the city. The duties of the two
committees are in a way complementary. While the
committee of inspection is occupied in matters external
in large measure, the school committee exercises functions
more pedagogical in nature, though it also has
general watch care over the affairs of the school. If
there be a superintendent of schools (<i>Skoleinspektor</i>), he
is a member <i>ex officio</i> of the school committee, and its
chairman. Under other conditions the school board
designates which of the appointed members of the
committee shall be its chairman. In towns where the
number of teachers exceeds sixty, the school board may
direct that the school committee shall consist of the
superintendent and the principals of the several schools
as <i>ex officio</i> members and any determined number of
other teachers selected by the body of teachers. The
elected members are to be male and female in proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
to their respective numbers on the teaching staff,
exclusive of those who are <i>ex officio</i> members of the
committee. The sexes separate into special meetings
for the purpose of election, each choosing its allotted
number of representatives. Election is for two years,
one-half retiring each year, the first time according to
lot. Members whose terms expire are required to
serve longer in case of re-election. This school committee
holds regular meetings, according to its own appointment,
at which the members are required to be
present. Furthermore, the chairman may call additional
meetings in cases of necessity, and he is required
to call special meetings when requested by the school
board to do so. A majority vote of the members is
sufficient for the passage of any proposition. While
the duties of this committee are not specifically outlined,
it is intended that its work shall concern chiefly
the internal workings of the schools. Its functions are
mainly pedagogical in character as already stated and
as evidenced in the following provisions in the law.
"The school board shall permit the school committee
to voice its opinions in every affair which concerns:
(1) the general supervision of primary schools, (2) general
provisions concerning regulations and discipline,
and (3) text books and outlines of instruction." In
addition the committee is required to express itself regarding
any matter relating to the good of the school
when asked by the board for advice.</p>

<p>The school board may also order that there be a
teachers' commission (<i>Laererraad</i>) for each school or
for the several schools using the same buildings, consisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
of the teachers in the school. The chairman
of this committee is the superintendent of schools, a
school principal, or other member, according to the
determination of the board. The duties devolving
upon this commission are in each case outlined by the
board.</p>

<p>The superintendent of schools (<i>Skoleinspektor</i>) has
general direction of all the primary schools in the city
system. His duties are similar to those of the superintendent
in American towns and cities. He takes the
lead in directing the policies of the schools and exercises
large powers in making them efficient. He is
provided with well-equipped offices, generally in one
of the school buildings, where he and his clerks, supplied
by the school board, do the greater portion of their
work.</p>

<p>A principal or headmaster (<i>Overlaerer</i>) is generally
placed in charge of each school. His duties are comparable
to those performed by ward principals in the
United States. While the superintendent is the
superior officer and exercises general control and authority,
the principal has immediate charge of the work
of the school. He controls its activities in harmony
with and under the direction of the superintendent,
consulting the wishes of the higher official and respecting
his opinions. The superintendent recognizes that
for the one in immediate charge of a school to have his
hands tied or his liberties too circumscribed means the
hampering of the work; hence, he gives to the principals
working under him wide latitude in carrying out their
ideas. For example, if the principal is a believer in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
coeducation or, on the other hand, a staunch advocate
of segregation of the sexes for instructional purposes, he
is usually privileged to carry his policy into execution
in his school, even though the views of the superintendent
are not wholly in accord therewith. Throughout
their work they seek each other's counsel and advice,
and cooperate successfully.</p>

<p>The private citizen in Norway plays only an indirect
part in school affairs, yet his interests are conserved
in various ways. The local pastor, who is a member
<i>ex officio</i> of the school board, generally guards the interests
of the masses. His influence and vote may be
regarded usually as a reflection of the popular mind.
The chairman of the municipal council, who also is a
member of the board by virtue of his position, is indirectly
the choice of the people. The teacher or
teachers chosen to occupy on the school board nearly
always work in harmony with the public will. The
committee of inspection has a majority of its members
chosen directly by vote of the people immediately concerned.
The press is free and educational movements
are continually discussed in the leading papers. Further
than this, educational affairs are common topics of
conversation, being talked of on all occasions under
various circumstances and conditions. It may be
said to their credit that those discussing these subjects
do so intelligently and critically. The masses are
alive to the educational situation, are intensely interested
in their schools, and are acquainted with the
provisions of the law concerning them. The people
being so democratic in tendency and so very frank in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
the expression of their feelings and opinions, naturally
reflect public sentiment; which because of being understood
has more weight and is correspondingly a greater
factor in legislative activities.</p>

<p>The primary schools receive their financial support
from the state, county, and commune. The state provides
for city schools one-third of straight salaries,
which range between twelve hundred and fourteen
hundred crowns for men, and between eight hundred
and nine hundred crowns for women; two-thirds of
additional salary paid because of long service to the
limit of eight hundred crowns per year for men and five
hundred crowns per year for women; and one-third of
salaries paid for positions requiring only part time, for
teaching by the hour, and for teaching in continuation
schools. In certain cases where the treasuries are
depleted the state treasury furnishes as high as forty-five
per cent of teachers' salaries within the fixed limits
mentioned above. In the rural communes the grant
received from the state amounts to forty-five per cent
of the teachers' salaries, and where finances are low
this amount may be increased to sixty per cent. The
amount of this state grant is figured on the basis of
salaries that do not exceed twenty-four crowns per week
in the second or higher division, and nineteen crowns in
the first or infant division of the primary school, except
in the county of Finnmarken where the bases may
be respectively twenty-eight crowns and twenty-two
crowns per week.</p>

<p>In each county (<i>Amt</i>) the county council provides
funds for the following purposes: raising teachers'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
salaries in case of long service, erecting school buildings,
supplying teachers' homes, paying substitute
teachers, purchasing apparatus, relieving communes
and municipalities where school expenses are disproportionately
high, and maintaining continuation
and artisan schools. Whatever is required to defray
the expenses of the primary schools, in addition to
state and county grants, tuition, receipts from school
lands or holdings, etc., is furnished by the commune
or municipality through its council.</p>

<p>The secondary schools are either state or communal.
The state schools are provided with grounds, buildings,
and equipment by the communes in which they are
located; the remaining expenses are met by state grants,
tuition fees, etc. The expense of maintaining communal
schools falls largely upon the communes. The
state furnishes one-third of the salaries in both classes
of schools, and all additional amounts paid to teachers
because of long service. While most of the secondary
schools charge regular tuition fees, all of them have
funds which supply free scholarships to a number of
pupils each year. In some communes they have been
able already to provide free middle schools, and it
appears at least possible that all state and communal
schools may sometime be free. The aim in financing
the school system is to equalize the burden of expense
as far as possible, and to recognize, at the same time,
the efforts of those directly concerned. In order to obtain
the best results, authority has been strongly centralized;
school boards, communal and county councils,
and state officials exercise large discretionary powers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>


<h4>VI. BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS</h4>

<p>The school buildings of Norway are justly reputed
to be the most magnificent, best located, and finest
edifices of the country. They are built of substantial
materials according to attractive architectural designs,
and are provided with liberal equipment. The larger
buildings are usually constructed of stone, brick and
stone, or brick and cement; while the smaller ones are
built of lumber and stone. In the erection of buildings,
great care is exercised to make them spacious and
permanent. All materials used are selected because of
their durability and suitability to purpose. In order
to guarantee the best hygienic conditions, the law provides
that buildings must meet the approval of experts
in hygiene before they can be used for school purposes.
This means that the services of these experts must be
secured in getting out designs for school buildings,
whether in the erection of new or the remodeling of old
ones.</p>

<p>The school buildings are heated by furnaces or stoves.
The newer ones are modern in every respect and, of
course, have excellent heating systems. Those which
have done service for several decades are usually heated
by stoves.</p>

<p>The buildings are divided into rooms in such a manner
that the daylight nearly always enters from the
left or the rear of the pupils when they are seated at
their desks. This rule is disregarded only in rare cases.
During the short days of winter it is essential to provide
artificial light. In cities and large towns they use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
electricity for lighting the school buildings; in the country
or in small towns, where the municipalities do not
maintain any central lighting plant, various devices
are installed. Sometimes gasoline is used and again
ordinary oil lamps are common. An abundance of
light of the best procurable quality is generally provided.</p>

<p>Besides admitting light the outside windows are of
use in providing ventilation for the school rooms.
They are opened wide during intermissions between
classes, so that when the children come in from their
exercise on the play grounds they enter an atmosphere
nearly as pure and fresh as that out of doors. In addition,
many schoolhouses, especially those built recently,
have regular ventilating devices.</p>

<p>The class room furniture in Norway, like that used
in many other European schools, is about as primitive
in design and lacking in attractiveness as anything found
in the whole country. Its evolution surely has been
greatly retarded. In each room there is a small platform
high enough to enable the instructor to see all
his pupils with ease. On this platform is a desk and a
high chair in which the teacher sits most of the time
while giving instruction.</p>

<p>The pupils' seats and desks are made of heavy
lumber and attached to a common base. This makes
them clumsy, and they appear very queer to one accustomed
to the better designs now in use in some countries.
Those of recent make are for but one pupil,
though older ones, some of which are still in use, accommodate
three or four. In construction the seat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
is generally a solid flat bench with a low back. The
desk has a slightly sloping top, a small inconvenient
shelf for books, and a receptacle for pencils, pens, rulers,
and other articles used by school children. The Norwegians
deserve commendation for the care exercised
in the arrangement of seats and desks. The distance
and proportion between them are regulated according
to scientific principles looking to the physical welfare
of the occupants. The bodily posture of children in
school determines in large measure what it will be out
of school. Far too little attention has been given the
physical side of education, and one of the important
problems in connection therewith is the proper construction
of schoolroom furniture.</p>

<p>In the smaller buildings, classrooms have commodious
cupboards for apparatus (maps, charts, globes,
plates, etc.), and various things with which the children
work (sewing materials, exercise books, etc.).
While they have a liberal supply of excellent illustrative
material and teaching apparatus and the best
of facilities for storing it, mechanical appliances for
its display and devices for its convenient use are woefully
lacking. Maps and charts are held in the hand
or hung on a nail or other fixture in the room; while
globes and the like are placed on chairs or improvised
stands. In general the apparatus is awkward to
manipulate and as a result much of its value is lost.</p>

<p>Blackboards of proper size are very rare in the schools
of Norway. As a rule the board is about three by
five feet in size and fastened to a clumsy easel which
elevates it so high that it is out of reach of the pupils.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
To enable the children to use such a board a small
platform is provided. The child mounts the platform
by means of a few steps and there stands and does his
blackboard work. In only one instance did the writer
during his visits to the schools find what appeared to
him to be an adequate amount of blackboard space.
This exceptional condition was in one of the primary
schools where special equipment was installed for the
instruction of children below normal intelligence.
The ample provision of blackboard here is proof of a
recognition of its value, and the situation may also
be regarded as an indictment against the prevalent
neglect in this line.</p>

<p>School room decorations are not as prominent as
might be expected. Despite the facts that the whole
of Norway is picturesque, that her artists are quite
numerous, and that the masses of her people are more
than ordinarily appreciative of the finer phases of life,
very few paintings or pieces of sculpture adorn her
schools. True, exceptions as to this rule of scant provision
of the artistic may be found; but, as in all countries,
they quite generally fail to appreciate the educative
values of art.</p>

<p>While, traditionally at least, the study and recitation
rooms have been considered of prime and greatest
importance in school buildings, there are others, accessory
to them, which in their effects are productive
of quite as good results. Among them may be mentioned:
offices, teachers' rooms, libraries, laboratories,
and other rooms for special purposes. Some of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
are not provided in all schools, but commonly all of
them are found in the city school buildings.</p>

<p>The offices for rectors, inspectors, head masters,
etc., are admirably arranged and handsomely appointed.
They are provided with desks, cabinets, chairs,
settees, tables, and other furnishings which add to
convenience and comfort. The rooms for teachers
are equipped and furnished in a way just as suitable
to their purpose. In these they spend their vacant
periods in study, reading, or in leisure, according to
their choice. Here, too, officers and teachers are
served with luncheons in the middle of forenoon and
afternoon sessions.</p>

<p>There are libraries in nearly all school buildings.
While many of them are small some are of large consequence.
The one in the Christiania Cathedral School
numbers thirty thousand volumes. This is one of the
oldest and perhaps the largest library in any school
of the country, and it is regarded with considerable
justifiable pride.</p>

<p>The laboratories are furnished in harmony with
their traditional plan of instruction. Instead of having
a supply of apparatus so that most or all of the pupils
may be occupied simultaneously in laboratory experimentation,
they have but one set of instruments.
However, they do furnish liberal quantities of materials
for laboratory experimentation. The teacher is the
chief operator, one or two pupils assist in the work,
and the other members of the class are onlookers.</p>

<p>Where domestic arts are taught, rooms are fitted up
especially for the purpose. Stoves, cooking utensils,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
and many other necessary articles are at hand ready
for use. The efficiency of the work is in no wise hindered
by lack of supplies. In many instances teachers
go themselves to the markets and purchase provisions
needed for the day. An earnest effort is made to combine
theory and practice in proportions suitable to obtaining
the best possible results.</p>

<p>Some of the larger buildings have special rooms for
the storing of apparatus and illustrative materials
(<i>Anskuelsesmidler</i>). Racks, cupboards, cabinets,
drawers, cases, and the like provide convenient means
for preserving these supplies and of rendering them
easily accessible. Gymnastic halls and lunch rooms
will be discussed in another section.</p>

<p>The playgrounds are generally small, but some of the
schools have, in addition to the grounds immediately
surrounding the buildings, athletic parks of considerable
proportions. The grounds about the school
buildings are arranged with a view of securing from
them maximum returns. They are enclosed by high
board or wire fence, or by stone or brick and cement
walls. A heavy coating of gravel is usually placed on
the ground in order to avoid the growth of vegetation
or an accumulation of dust. "Keep off the grass"
signs are not in evidence, for rarely do they attempt to
have grassy lawns.</p>

<p>They recognize the need and value of physical exercise
in the open, and provide means for it in connection
with every school. It is specifically required that all
pupils go on to the playgrounds during the intermissions
(<i>fri Krarterer</i>) which come between all lessons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
While the children are at play one or more of the
teachers are detailed to supervise the grounds, while
others are to patrol the hallways. Large roofs are put
up under which the children play when the weather is
not favorable to being in the open. On rare occasions
when the weather is bitter, pupils may be permitted
to remain indoors. Children whose health is extremely
delicate are dealt with in leniency, and some
of them are permitted to remain inside regularly.</p>

<p>Near to the school buildings, generally on a corner
of the grounds, homes are provided for the head master
or principal and the janitor (<i>Vagtmester</i>). Sometimes
the janitor and his family live in an apartment in the
school building. Generally, however, a double house
is erected, one part for the principal and the other for
the janitor. These homes are furnished rent free to
these men.</p>

<p>Teachers in rural districts, as a rule, are supplied
with a house and sufficient ground for garden and the
pasturage of two or three cows. These provisions materially
reduce living expenses, and, in a way, recompense
for the low salaries received. In one rural school
the writer found three hundred and fifty pupils taught
in two divisions&mdash;forenoon and afternoon sessions&mdash;by
six teachers. The principal had been in charge of
the school forty-three years. One portion of the school
building provided a residence for him and his family.
They had a small garden; a fruit orchard; a few acres
of land for pasturage and hay; and a barn and sheds
for cow, pig, and chickens. There are many similar
situations throughout the country. This particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
one lay just outside a small city, and this fact accounts
in part for the large number of pupils in attendance.</p>

<p>As a rule the homes for rural school teachers compare
very favorably with the better class of homes in
the surrounding neighborhood. They have sufficient
room, are comfortable, and generally satisfy the occupants.
The majority of rural teachers have such
homes provided, though only a few city teachers enjoy
this favor. In 1905, two thousand, eight hundred
and twenty-six rural teachers had homes furnished
them free of cost.</p>


<h4>VII. GENERAL FEATURES OF INNER ORGANIZATION</h4>

<p>Most of the teachers in the rural primary schools are
men, while the majority of them in the city are women.
During the year 1907 there were four thousand, one
hundred and twenty-three male and one thousand,
four hundred and seven female teachers occupying regular
positions in the rural schools, and in the city their
numbers were respectively eight hundred and twenty-eight
and one thousand, six hundred and six. Although
the law makes no requirements as to sex, except that
in city schools there must be at least one master and
one governess, there are certain forces operative which
almost equal edicts of law. Traditionally, teachers in
the rural schools are men and, as previously stated,
homes are provided for them and their families. Appointments
to teaching positions are permanent.
Teachers remain in their places until death removes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
them or until they choose to retire on pension, which is,
all too often, long after they pass the time of their
efficiency. It is difficult to break with the old customs
and hence the entrance of women teachers into the rural
school positions has been slow. In the cities the conditions
are different. There only a small percentage
of the teachers have homes furnished them, the number
of teaching positions without supervising responsibility
is large, and the salaries paid to women are lower than
those paid to men. As a consequence the female
teachers have found easy entrance into the city schools,
and at present they outnumber the men two to one.
Women have been teaching since 1869, and the people
are convinced that their ability as teachers is equal to
that of the sterner sex.</p>

<p>In the secondary schools, also, the majority of the
instructors are men. In the gymnasia practically all
of them are men, but in the middle schools there are
many women teachers. Even though the Norwegians
recognize woman's ingenuity and efficiency in teaching
small children, they have not yet become converted
to the idea that she is man's equal in the more advanced
educational fields. It seems probable that tradition
is the chief hindrance to the entrance of women into
teaching positions in the gymnasia.</p>

<p>In their plan of instruction there is much to commend
and some things to criticise. The teachers do a large
amount of teaching, but they also provide opportunity
for the children to do a great deal on their own initiative,
so that they too may know the joy of discovery
and feel the triumph of mastery. The Norwegian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
pedagogue uses the recitation period, nearly always
fifty minutes, in an endeavor to impart information,
both directly and indirectly; directly by straightforward
giving, and indirectly through cooperative mental
activities. While they feel the importance of direct
instruction, they see, also, the advantage in shifting
a part of the responsibility to the pupils. They recognize
the fact that the child has ability, and that by
himself he is capable of finding and recognizing problems,
and of working them out to satisfying conclusions.
They appreciate that even a small child is able
to carry out many educative activities with a minimum
of direction from the teacher, and that the development
which comes from this self-direction and initiative is
one of the most valuable ends of education. The intent
is that the class period shall be devoted to exercises
which will furnish information and, at the same time,
make the children independent and able to direct
themselves.</p>

<p>Though the ideals and aims are excellent, the means
for attaining them are not the best. There is a certain
inherited aloofness on the part of the instructor which
robs both teacher and pupils of some of the values
which come from closer association. During the recitation
hour the teacher nearly always occupies the high
chair on the elevated platform, except while using the
blackboard or doing other demonstrational work. My
observations convince me that the teachers, especially
the men, do not get down and work among and with the
children as much as seems essential to the accomplishment
of the greatest good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the discipline and character of recitations also
deserve attention. When a pupil is called upon to recite,
he is expected to pass to the aisle and there stand
erect until the recitation is completed. Only in rare
cases are children allowed to sit while reciting. I have
seen children only eleven or twelve years of age called
to the front of the room to analyze and develop a problem.
The smallest children are required to give only
short answers to questions, but responses rapidly increase
in length, as age advances, until they amount
to minute and extended discussions of topics. Recitations
lasting ten to fifteen minutes are not uncommon,
and the children become quite expert in the relation of
facts and in the development of problems presented.
This method of procedure is perhaps all right for a certain
class of children, but timid boys and girls are sometimes
embarrassed to the extent that they are unable
to do credit to themselves, their teachers, or the lessons.
On one occasion I saw a boy who was so frightened in
an attempt to stand and recite, being required at the
same time to look into the face of a complaining teacher,
that he was unable to say anything whatever. The
teacher, a man of advanced age, finally awoke to the
situation, and placing his hand on the boy's head,
talked to him about the lesson until he calmed the lad's
fears and obtained a very satisfactory response from
him.</p>

<p>In addition to classroom activities connected with
mental growth, considerable work is done looking to
physical development. Gymnastic exercise is required
of all children in primary and secondary schools, excepting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
those in first and second grades and a few who
are physically disqualified for it. To provide for this
work, the city schools furnish large halls with excellent
equipment, and special teachers to give instruction.
A Swedish system of gymnastics is in vogue throughout
the country. There seems to be no criticism against
the system, and the benefits testify emphatically to
its efficiency. The apparatus is simple and inexpensive,
but the variety of movements and the numberless combinations
of them seem to answer every demand.</p>

<p>Certain conditions and customs prevailing in Norway
make it necessary to serve lunches at the school
buildings. The morning sessions are long and the dinner
hour is far later than noon&mdash;generally two or three
o'clock. Furthermore, many children of poor parentage
come to school underfed. Opportunity to obtain
a light lunch of nourishing food and a warm drink at
about 10:30 or 11 o'clock is an appreciated necessity.
Hence most buildings have lunch rooms arranged and
equipped according to local demands. Here, in the
secondary schools, the family of the janitor furnishes
rolls, buns, cakes, cocoa, coffee, milk, etc., at a reasonable
rate. As stated before, the teachers have lunches
served in their own rooms. Some cities provide children
in the primary schools with one meal of wholesome
food each day of school during the winter months&mdash;generally
from the middle of October until the first of
May. This is free to the needy children, and others
obtain it at first cost.</p>

<p>In Christiania they have a central kitchen from
which the city primary schools receive supplies. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
kitchen has a capacity for steam cooking, ten thousand
liters at a time. Only the best food is purchased.
This is carefully prepared and delivered every day in
tightly sealed cans to the several schools where it is
served hot. The maintenance of this kitchen is in
answer to recommendations made by a committee,
appointed by the school board, after visiting various
similar European institutions and studying carefully
into their operations. In equipment, management,
and good results it is not surpassed in any city in
Europe or America. In some of the schools, hundreds
of free meals are dispensed every day throughout the
long winter. During the year 1908-1909, from October
19, 1908, to April 30, 1909, (one hundred and thirty-two
days), the Christiania central kitchen furnished
616,821 free meals and 77,733 meals which were paid
for by children in the schools. This work stands as a
testimonial to the beneficence of the people whose circumstances
enable them to maintain it.</p>

<p>The discipline of the school borders on the military
order. The pupils form in line and march in passing
to and from classrooms and playgrounds. While the
work of instruction proceeds strict discipline is maintained.
Before entering a classroom where a recitation
is in progress, one invariably knocks at the door,
whoever he is and whatever his errand, and by the time
he enters teacher and pupils are on their feet. Turning
to the one entering, they bow and continue to face
him until he is seated, which is a signal to them to sit.
Should the visitor withdraw before the class is dismissed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
the pupils again rise to their feet and bow him out;
but, if he remains until they are dismissed, they bow
to him before taking their departure. Every activity
indoors and out of doors is closely supervised, and the
control exercised over the pupils is praiseworthy.</p>

<p>Attendance at school is regular in all grades. When
children are absent for any reason the case is inquired
into without delay, and, unless satisfactory excuse or
explanation is forthcoming, the truant officers are on
hand to enforce regulations. Failure to comply with
the laws regarding absence from school, subjects parents
or guardians of children to a fine of from one to
twenty-five crowns.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Very rarely is an enforcement
of these laws necessary, for the people are generally law-abiding
and peace-loving. Being eager for development,
they gladly comply with educational provisions
without any compulsion, and regularity in attendance
is the universal practice. Sickness is perhaps the most
common excuse given for absence and, since excellent
health is characteristic of the people, this is infrequent.</p>

<p>Pupils are nearly always healthy, vigorous, and robust.
One of the chief points calling attention to this
is the rarity of cases where glasses are worn. In visiting
schools I noticed that spectacled children were very
few. I was at first inclined to criticise what I interpreted
to be neglect of the eyes, but soon found that
eyesight, as well as the general health of the children,
was being carefully guarded. Every school has its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
physician whose duty it is to regulate sanitation and to
remedy physical defects of children. I ascertained
that in some schools special examinations had been
conducted for the testing of eyesight, and results showed
that very few of the pupils were under the necessity
of wearing glasses. Among the causes contributing
to this favorable situation may be mentioned a healthful
climate, regular drill in gymnastics, proper lighting
of school rooms, good ventilation, physical exercise
in the open between successive classes, and, in general,
the maintenance of a high state of physical vigor. The
Norse take justifiable pride in their physical development,
and they pay considerable attention to this phase
of education. Consequently the children are able to
attack the strenuous activities of school life with vim,
and mastery of the course of study is not a hardship.</p>

<h2>Chapter II</h2>

<h3>TEACHERS</h3>


<h4>I. QUALIFICATIONS AND CERTIFICATION</h4>

<p>Teaching is a profession in Norway.
Those following it have chosen it as their
life work. The people thus engaged deserve
and receive the recognition, confidence, and
esteem of the masses, and they maintain the dignity of
their calling. As a class they rank high educationally,
morally, and professionally. With the advance in social
ideals it has been necessary to raise the standards
of preparation for teaching, and, as the years pass, further
changes will be required. For a long time, professional
training has been demanded of every appointee
to a teaching position, and indications point to a rapid
development of the quality of this training until every
resource is operative.</p>

<p>The law requires that to be eligible for appointment
to a regular teaching position in the secondary schools
(middle school and gymnasium), one must have had
a course in the university and special training provided
in the pedagogical seminary. This means that the
candidate has completed: (1) the twelve years of work
in the primary and secondary schools, where a wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
range of instruction and general culture are provided;
(2) a course in the university (four to seven years in
length), devoted to exhaustive research in the particular
branches of study which are subsequently to be taught;
and (3) the course of training given in the pedagogical
seminary.</p>

<p>It is the aim and function of this seminary to provide
for the university graduates who are to become teachers
the most practical and complete professional training
possible within the limits of time (six months). It is
readily evident that excellence in educational equipment
and intelligent insight into the business of teaching
are among the accomplishments of the profession.
In fact, mastery of the field to be taught and professional
training in its presentation are requisites.</p>

<p>The certificates or diplomas issued upon completion
of the preparatory work just outlined are the only credentials
required of the Norwegian teachers. Being
issued by the state they have a standard of value which
is uniform, recognized, and honored throughout the
realm. Without these papers it would be folly to seek
appointment to a fixed (permanent) post.</p>

<p>Besides the regular corps of instructors occupying
on full time in the general lines of instruction, there are
many special teachers devoting their energies along
particular lines of work, such as home economics, drawing,
music, gymnastics, and manual training; and still
others who teach some of the regular branches of study
only part time, whose positions are not permanent.
Special preparation is required in order to obtain positions
in these specific lines of work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>


<h4>II. TRAINING OF TEACHERS</h4>

<p>Norway early recognized the value of specific training
for the work of the teacher. The experiences of
other nations served as object lessons illustrating the
good coming from the services of properly equipped
teachers and the dangers of proceeding without such.
The state was eager to lay substantial foundations, to
conserve and develop every resource, to build permanently
and economically, and to profit by the experiences
of other systems. Consequently, the people
moved forward in a conservative manner and planned
for the future as well as for immediate needs.</p>

<p>Utilizing the strong points of other systems and
adapting them to local conditions, the state established
six teachers' seminaries, locating one in each of the six
dioceses into which the country is divided, so that they
would be within easy access of the people attending
them. Besides these state seminaries, four private
institutions, having almost identical functions, have
been established and are flourishing. The private
seminaries are located at vantage points not too close
to the State Schools yet where they will be
within reach of a large number of people. The favorable
location of these schools makes it possible for a
large number of the attendants to live in their own
homes, while the large majority need be but a short
distance from their homes.</p>

<p>The work of the teachers' seminaries is, of course, to
provide special preparation for teaching in the schools
throughout the nation. Their curricula are similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
to those used in the secondary schools. The chief
point of difference between them is the attitude taken
toward the subjects of instruction. In the secondary
schools the aim is general and in a large measure cultural,
while in the seminaries the attempt is always
to present the lesson or subjects of instruction in such
a manner that the pupils shall get both intellectual
development and the correct method of presentation.
It is the intent that this experience shall help to qualify
for the successful teaching of the subjects studied.
The work corresponds closely with that done in the
normal schools of America or similar teachers' schools
in other lands.</p>

<p>It is everywhere true that teachers teach as they
have been taught. The principle of imitation is illustrated
clearly every day in every school room. Teachers,
like pupils, follow example more closely than precept.
Providing schools designed to fit people for the
teaching profession have ideal teachers, they will be
able to turn out from year to year groups of teachers,
who, imitating their masters, both in the application
of scientific principles of method and in the exercise
of individuality, will in turn become ideal teachers.
If the curriculum and teaching of the training college
are rich and varied, its products will be characterized by
efficiency and resourcefulness. On the contrary, should
the work of the school be narrow because of a cramped
curriculum, or on account of biased and shrunken ideals
of the faculty, the results will be unsatisfactory. The
teachers who go out from such an institution will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
unequal to the tasks awaiting them&mdash;they will be unable
to meet the situation in the educational field.</p>

<p>Since it is a chief occupation of the training school to
instill methods of presentation, there is great danger of
becoming mechanical, machine-made, or stilted in one
way or another. Quite the opposite must be the nature
and work of the teacher. The teacher should be able
to come down from the high platform and cooperate
with the children; to find the individual child and his
interests and, in a genuinely sympathetic spirit, to
direct those interests; to discard set rules, hard and fast
lines, and pet theories; and to open up to each child a
vision of the fields before. In order to do these things
the instructor must be thoroughly familiar with child
life: its nature, mental and physical make-up, processes
of development, conditions of growth and activity,
instincts, and hopes. He must also cherish and
manifest a sympathetic attitude towards youthful
tendencies and aspirations, and be able to inspire the
pupils to noble purposes.</p>

<p>The seminaries of Norway, like those of other nations,
fall short of some of the conditions of excellence that
we yearn for. They do not include a sufficient amount
of professional training nor is that which is provided
always the ideal type. Nevertheless, an earnest effort
is being put forth to approach these higher conditions
as rapidly as possible. The course of three years,
besides furnishing a valuable fund of instruction, provides
a large amount of work in observation and extensive
experience in teaching. The training in observation
generally consists of work in connection with the state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
schools (primary and secondary) in the immediate
vicinity of the seminary. Into these state schools the
seminary pupils are permitted to go and observe the
teaching of the regularly employed instructors as they
present the different subjects in the curriculum. After
having observed teaching for some time and having
carefully discussed class room procedure with their own
teachers, they are required to specially prepare and
present some lessons under the close, yet sympathetic
scrutiny and supervision of their masters. As time
passes, more and more of this practice teaching is assigned
until proficiency is attained in the presentation
of subjects to be taught in subsequent years. While
these schools do not incorporate into their activities
all things that seem important, it must be said to their
credit that they have done a great service in qualifying
teachers for the class of instruction which has already
raised the masses to their present place of literary
distinction.</p>

<p>Besides the institutions providing teachers' training
above referred to, there was established in 1907 the
Pedagogical seminary. This seminary is affiliated with
the university in Christiania but is not an organic part
of it. It was founded by act of the Stortbing and is
supported by the state. The function of the Pedagogical
Seminary is to provide professional training of
an especially practical type for graduates of the university
who intend to make teaching their profession.
The length of the course is six months. Instruction
and training provided in this institution includes: (1)
lectures in hygiene, psychology, history of education,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
and principles of education; (2) observation of class
instruction by masters, whose teaching is the highest
representation of the art in the city; (3) discussions,
formal and informal, general and analytic, with the
headmaster of the seminary concerning methods of
instruction, class conduct, and school management;
and (4) practice teaching under the supervision of
masters whose criticisms are given in such frank and
sympathetic manner as to make them invaluable.</p>

<p>As a rule, those trained in the teachers' seminaries
are employed in the primary schools. The students
who avail themselves of the advantages of a university
education and follow it by the training provided in the
Pedagogical Seminary generally become teachers in
the secondary schools. The seminary training in general
is of such character that it may be put into use immediately
upon entrance into the work of teaching.
It also renders vital and usable for purposes of instruction
the information and intellectual development
gained during the long-continued and intensive schooling
preceding such training.</p>


<h4>III. TEACHERS' OFFICIAL TITLES</h4>

<p>Throughout the school system of Norway teachers
are given titles according to the nature of the positions
occupied. In the primary school the man who does
the supervising work (in America known as superintendent)
is called the <i>Inspektor</i>; the head teacher or
principal is termed the <i>Overlaerer</i>; and the other
teachers, male and female, are spoken of respectively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
as <i>Laerer</i> and <i>Laererinde</i>. In the middle school and
gymnasium the titles are <i>Rektor</i>, <i>Overlaerer</i>, and <i>Adjunkt</i>.
The <i>Rektor</i> has the supervisory work and some
teaching to do; the <i>Overlaerer</i> is one of the principal
teachers who has been given the title and ranking,
chiefly because of fitness and long service; and the
<i>Adjunkt</i> is a regular teacher who has served the school
for five years or more and has received permanent
appointment.</p>

<p>Titles do not correspond strictly to educational equipment
nor do they depend wholly upon term of service,
though both of these may be and generally are contributory
factors. For example: positions in the middle
schools and gymnasia are open only to those who
have certain educational fitness; the teachers with
especially strong qualifications and superior ability
are the ones most liable to receive early promotion to
the higher class positions; and, when promotions are
made, the persons who have taught for a long time enjoy
some advantage over those with but slight experience.
Titles correspond more definitely to classes of
positions occupied than to any other thing that can be
named. When an individual is appointed to a position
carrying a title, that designation is invariably used in
connection with his name. He is no longer John Johnson
or Herr Johnson, but <i>Rektor</i> Johnson, <i>Overlaerer</i>
Johnson, <i>Inspektor</i> Johnson, etc.</p>


<h4>IV. TEACHERS' TENURE OF OFFICE</h4>

<p>The teacher's tenure of office in Norway is very different
from what we are accustomed to in America.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Positions are of two kinds&mdash;permanent and temporary.
Nearly all appointments in the past have been to permanent
posts. This means that the individual occupies
his place without molestation or any hint of
insecurity until he chooses to resign or until he reaches
the age of retirement.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Some appointments now are
to temporary positions though generally they lead to
permanent ones. Rarely, if ever, does a person who
makes reasonable success in a temporary position fail
to secure an appointment to a permanent post.</p>

<p>Permanency in position has a number of well-recognized
advantages. Security of situation gives to the
teacher a release from the uncertainty which constantly
harasses the minds of so many where frequent change
of position is the rule. A lasting appointment enables
one to get a firm grasp on the local situation, and to
utilize without waste all the momentum accumulated
while occupying in a particular place. Furthermore,
the teacher who feels settled in a position is able to establish
a home, and to become identified with the community
and its interest.</p>

<p>Since teachers continue for so long a time in a position,
they and their pupils become as well acquainted
with each other as with members of a common family.
It is interesting to note how minutely a teacher knows
the daily life and habits of his pupils. While the relations
are not always the most congenial, they are known
to be practically inevitable and impossible of escape
so they each make the best of the situation and get the
most out of it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>
<p>Again, when children know that it will be their lot to
come under the tuition of a certain instructor who occupies
a permanent post under state appointment, they
work faithfully and usually eliminate any criticising
attitude. In fact, long terms of service tend to inhibit
the criticisms of both children and parents which sometimes
attend teachers who occupy positions but for a
short time. The situation conduces to a condition of
harmony and cooperative activity. The children instinctively
feel the authority of the teacher. They
know that he has the support of local and state authorities,
and that they will cooperate with him in carrying
forward his projects. The teacher, in turn, recognizes
his responsibilities in the premises and endeavors to
occupy acceptably.</p>

<p>Now it is just as true that there are some disadvantages
to permanency of positions. Teachers are apt
to become non-progressive and in some cases, little
more than fixtures. Change of environment stimulates
progress and development. Variety in teaching experience
broadens the capabilities and increases the
usefulness of teachers. In addition, children need the
touch and influence of many lives. They receive greater
inspiration because of coming in contact with the
personality of a large number of teachers. However,
too frequent change is wasteful. It dissipates the
energy of teachers and breaks the continuity of the
work of the children. Where the permanency of positions
is absolutely uncertain, the teaching profession
is transitory and dwindling. Only a few remain for
long time in the work under such conditions. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
efficient school men leave the profession annually because
of this discouragement.</p>

<p>At present, the feeling appears to be general that
permanency in position should be conditioned upon improvement
in efficiency. Evidently a recognition of
this principle is a basic cause underlying the increase
in number of appointments to temporary teaching
positions. This procedure affords an excellent opportunity
for weeding out the unfit. At the same time it
acts as a spur inducing growth and development.
Progressive tendencies, along with other qualifications,
are regarded necessary to appointment even to temporary
posts, and, as implied before, success in such
positions is a prerequisite to appointment to permanent
ones.</p>

<p>In America, teacher's tenure of office is very short.
Each year there are many changes in the personnel of
teachers throughout the country. Here we have the
extreme of uncertainty, while in Norway they go to the
limits of certainty in teaching positions. Both these
extremes are unfortunate. Could a golden mean be
reached which would include proper incentives to and
recognition of continuous self-improvement and a
reasonable sense of security in permanent occupation,
the profession would call into its ranks a large and more
efficient body of men and women, and the schools would
make greater and more substantial progress. In order
to illustrate the permanency of positions in Norway
Table VI has been arranged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>It is immediately apparent that the changes in the
body of teachers are rare. It is also evident that nearly
all who leave the profession do so on legitimate grounds.
A few changes result from transfers in position, a large
per cent of withdrawals are retirements after extended
periods of service, and many vacancies are due to death.
Fifty per cent or more of the women who retire do so on
account of marrying, a few die at their posts, and many
retire on pensions. Very few of the women teachers
retire to enter other lines of work. While the table
does not indicate how much longer than thirty years
some teachers remain in the service, it may be added
here that examples are not rare where individuals continue
teaching for more than half a century. In most
cases teachers occupy the same position throughout
their teaching experience.</p>


<h4>V. TEACHERS' SALARIES</h4>

<p>The salaries received by teachers do not average high
in Norway. Many provisions are made, however, for
the reduction of their living expenses. All those who
serve the school authorities in Norway receive certain
benefits appertaining to the positions they hold. For
example: There is advance in salaries on promotions
and after specified periods of service; teachers are exempt
from expense incident to particular offices; school
authorities send all official communications through
the mail free of postage; teachers receive pensions on
retirement from positions; the rural school teachers
frequently receive, in addition to their salary, a house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
to live in and sufficient land for the pasturage of two or
three cows, and in towns and cities some of the teachers
have homes provided, or are allowed a certain amount
per year for living expenses. These and similar concessions
and provisions are extended to the teachers
according to enactments of the state, individual communes,
or municipalities. Generally, a regular schedule
is made out by which salaries are governed. Table VII
indicates the salaries for different positions in eight
cities of Norway:</p>

<p>The table is made up from the salary schedules of
typical cities of various sizes. The values are in <i>kroner</i>
(one <i>krone</i> is practically the equivalent of twenty-seven
cents in United States money). We note that salaries
are medium in the beginning, and that they increase
at regular intervals until certain limits are reached.
When we consider these limiting salaries, the long service
generally rendered at the highest rate, certainty
of position, and the pension to be received upon retirement,
we are prone to admit that the advantages
are not altogether in favor of the higher salaries paid
in our American schools. True, the American teacher
generally receives larger returns in dollars and cents,
but the Norwegian pedagogue is less mercenary than
his American cousin. He is satisfied when his wants
and those of his family are liberally provided for. His
life is not strenuous. It is happy and filled with the
joys of service and the companionship of youthful
souls. Anxieties are in large measure overcome by the
assurance that the state will provide necessities when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the time for retirement comes. Pensions are graduated
according to individual necessity as well as with reference
to position, term of service, and salary at the time
of retirement.</p>

<h2>Chapter III</h2>

<h3>COURSES OF STUDY IN STATE SCHOOLS</h3>


<h4>I. INTRODUCTORY&mdash;RISE, DEVELOPMENT, AND PRESENT FORM OF THE CURRICULUM</h4>

<p>We come now to a consideration of the
course of study in the school system
as it has evolved and is now operative.
As was true throughout other parts of
Europe, so in Norway, education during the middle
ages issued almost exclusively from the cloister and
cathedral schools (<i>Dom-og Kathedral Skoler</i>), and in
them are found the germs of most modern courses of
study. Inasmuch as the successive steps in the evolution
of the recent schools of Europe from the earlier
forms vary but little in the several countries, and since
the subject is already familiar to nearly all students
of education, we omit any technical discussion of that
interesting feature of history, and refer the reader to
any of the several works treating it fully. Suffice it
to say, the aim of the church in maintaining these
earlier schools centered in the development of a qualified
clergy about whom should be gathered a loyal following,
well-trained in the dogmas, doctrines, and traditions
of the organization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>At this time the monk and a small company of disciples
constituted the school. The little group studied
together from day to day in and about the cloister or
cathedral. Among them, very naturally, certain new
thoughts and ideals sprung up. The masters saw the
new developments if they were not themselves parties
to them. As the newer thoughts became fixed in the
youthful minds, individual interests pressed harder
and harder still until provision was made for extending
the work of instruction as well as for widening the scope
of activities within the schools. While the aim was
at first to give instruction and discipline in lines necessary
to a clerical career, it changed by degrees until it
included branches useful in legitimate occupations
other than that of the clergy. However, the diversifying
of school activities and the enrichment of the program
of study did not keep pace with the changes that
were taking place in other phases of the social cosmos.
A spirit of unrest grew to proportions almost ungovernable
until the middle age renaissance in learning removed
the fetters and brought relief by effecting systems
of education very fitting to the requirements.
Great credit is due to the leaders in the Reformation for
the part they played in placing means for instruction
and education upon a more secure and permanent
basis, and for the service they rendered in giving to
the schools certain vitality that had rarely, if ever,
been characteristic of any similar institution.</p>

<p>The new type of school bore a stamp of general approval
which enabled it to gain a momentum which was
not soon to be overcome. In fact, the schools of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
more civilized countries are still largely dominated by
traditions dating back to the epoch-making works of
such men as Erasmus, Luther, Melanchthon, and Sturm.</p>

<p>Now the ideas of these famous educators were less
subjected to change in Norway than in the centers from
whence they came. Until the union between this country
and Denmark came to an end in 1814, very little
thought was given to advancing educational interests
in Norway. The work of her cathedral schools had
been little improved during the centuries that had
passed since their establishment. When at last Norway
became a free constitutional state and these Norsemen
breathed the air of freedom, felt the exhilaration
of greater personal liberties, realized that their destiny
was to be of their own making, and fully sensed their
important responsibilities in the situation, they all,
ecclesiasts and politicians, capitalists and laborers,
combined in developing their schools in ways calculated
to lift the masses to higher intellectual planes. The
changes wrought were in relation to what was to be
taught and to the extension of learning. An opportunity
for instruction was given to every youth in the
land.</p>

<p>For a long time the ancient languages formed the
bulk of higher learning, while in the primary schools
only the rudiments of a few subjects were attempted.
Social tendencies soon required an increase in the number
of branches to be taught, and also laid added weight
upon the importance of such study as would be of benefit
in vocational activities. Accordingly, mathematics,
history, geography, and nature study became more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
prominent features in all schools. One of the best
characteristics of the work throughout is that the
mother-tongue has been at all times a dominating factor
through every grade of their schools. Later in the process
a demand for the modern foreign languages was
responded to favorably and they took places in the
curriculum of the higher school. These changes bring
us down through the last century to the recent forms
in courses of study and we shall introduce the reader
immediately into the present situation.</p>

<p>Besides the institutions for higher learning there are
now three distinct sections in the school system of Norway,
viz.: Primary School, Middle School, and Gymnasium.
The primary school is designed to provide education
of an elementary type for every citizen of the
country. By vital cooperation and the exercise of great
care in organization, distribution, supervision, and inspection
of these schools, the people have overcome illiteracy
and have reduced truancy to a minimum&mdash;almost
to a negligible factor. They are unitedly converted to
the belief that an enlightened populace is a necessity to
the continuity of desirable institutions, to the development
of resources, and to the maintenance of worthy
traditions. To secure for all the essentials of good and
intelligent citizenship, an attempt has been made to
have the curriculum for the primary schools include
the branches of study which have meaning in every
walk of life, and which enhance the efficiency of each
citizen in his individual activities. In short, it is the
intent that all the people shall have the more abundant
life which comes with a thorough, general, elementary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
education; and, at the same time, that they shall be
prepared for the higher schools which build on the broad
foundation of the common school.</p>

<p>Following the primary schools are the middle schools
which lead still farther in the pathway of intellectual
development those whose situation in life enables them
to proceed with school work. Besides carrying forward
the lines of study begun in the lower school with
added vigor and exactitude, they include a large amount
of work in foreign modern languages. Thus we see
that this second section in the great institution of learning
fills in the elementary framework, enriches the
fund of information, adds a considerable amount of culture,
and paves the way for the more liberal training
to follow in the next section.</p>

<p>The Gymnasium succeeds and builds directly upon
the work of the middle school. Its function is to provide
a liberal culture and education suited to the needs
and desires of those who become in large part the leaders
in all phases of political, professional, or other social
careers.</p>

<p>Thus we note that the succeeding steps taken in the
educational ladder are in harmony with and dependent
upon preceding work. While only a correspondingly
small number pass to the summit, all the people enjoy
the advantages of the broad fundamentals and generalizations
which lie at the base of their educational system
and equip very well for the common walks and vocations
of life. In our discussion we shall separate the
work of the three sections and consider them one at a
time. It seems advisable to handle them in this way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
and we believe that a more adequate conception of the
work as a whole will be obtained by offering first the
part affecting all the people and dealing with the primary
schools.</p>


<h4>II. THE PRIMARY SCHOOLS</h4>

<p>The primary schools are of two kinds,&mdash;those specially
designed for the rural sections of the country and
others provided for the towns and cities, the latter
being somewhat richer in curricula, more complete in
organization, and more thorough in operation than the
former. Considering the fact that such uniformity
characterizes the courses of study in the various schools,
it will be necessary to present but one outline for each
class of schools. An effort has been made to select
courses that are representative and which clearly set
forth typical conditions. Table VIII gives the program
of work offered in one of the rural communes, and
shows the number of hours per week devoted to each
branch of study for the seven years in the course. Just
after the legislative act of 1889, the Department sent
out a "normal plan" which served as a guide in arranging
the time-tables for rural municipalities. As a
result great uniformity exists.</p>

<p>The comparative table on page 106 clearly evidences
the similarities already referred to and, at the same time,
serves to indicate all variations. However, in the making
of comparisons, difference in the number and distribution
of hours is more a matter of method or correlation
between branches than an indication of actual
difference in accomplishment. For example, a large
number of hours for writing <i>may</i> mean exclusively
work in practice writing, but it is very probable that
it will include a considerable amount of work in the
mother-tongue or a definite correlation with nature
study, history, or religion. The fundamental standard
by which work is judged or measured is whether it prepares
the pupil fully for work in the middle school.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Religion Reading Reckoning Riting</span></h4>

<p>The four R's in Norway's educational
system form the center of their
educational endeavors. Only a superficial
glance at the tables presented is
necessary in order to notice their
prominence throughout the course of study. While
the amount of time devoted to them is in itself a sufficiently
strong indication of their predominance, we
must also carry in mind an allowance for closest possible
correlation between them as constant and additional
factors along the same line. Bearing these
things in mind we enter at once upon the discussion
of the course of study or school plan. Though the
programs presented and digest of plans following or
accompanying are taken from particular schools, the
discussion throughout will be general unless otherwise
specified. For varied reasons, but chiefly because they
are typical, specific, and concrete, the courses of study
used in Christiania&mdash;primary and secondary&mdash;are chosen
as illustrations. The following is not a verbatim
translation of Christiania's plan of instruction but an
abbreviated statement of the work as outlined in their
published school plan (<i>Skoleplan</i>). I have endeavored
to select the more vital points throughout and to
represent them as exactly as a condensed version renders
possible. Where inaccuracies or omissions occur
they are due to a demand for economy&mdash;the things
omitted not being regarded as absolute essentials to a
correct representation of the intent and spirit of the
work as carried on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>


<h4>OUTLINE OF SUBJECTS OF INSTRUCTION</h4>

<h4><i>Religion</i></h4>

<p><i>Aim.</i> The aims of instruction in religion are to develop
the religious instincts of the children and to instill
in them a recognition of Christianity, out of which
may grow a healthy Christian life and a clear conception
of the church.</p>

<p>To attain these, an effort is made to impart the following
fund of information:</p>

<p>Definite acquaintance with the more important parts
of Bible history, with the chief events in church history,
and with the catechism according to the Evangelical
Lutheran creed.</p>


<h4><i>First Division</i></h4>

<p><i>Class I.</i> (Six half hour periods weekly.) Instruction
during the beginning weeks consists in simple
stories, songs, hymns, prayers, and conversations designed
to impart a knowledge of Christianity, ethics,
and morals; to effect definite connections with previous
home training; and to awaken and develop religious
and moral attitudes in the children preparatory to the
more direct instruction to follow.</p>

<p>The real instruction in Christianity or religion begins
with Bible stories selected from the Old and New Testaments
and specially adapted to the understanding of the
children and their ability to master the same. The
following stories are among the ones used: The Story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
of Joseph, Samuel and Hannah, David and Goliath,
The Birth of Jesus, The Three Wise Men, Jesus in the
Temple, Jesus Feeding the Five Thousand, Jesus
Raising the Widow's Son, Jesus Blessing the Children,
Jesus Teaching the Disciples How to Pray. The stories
are presented orally and explained and elucidated in
such a way that the children may receive clear and vivid
pictures of the persons and events referred to, appreciate
their connections with the Holy Scriptures, and be
able to rehearse the narratives in an intelligent manner.
Whenever possible the religious or moral content of
the conversation should be brought to a climax in a
simple passage of Scripture, a response from the catechism,
or a verse of some hymn, which should be
memorized.</p>

<p><i>Class II.</i> (Six half hour periods weekly.) Bible
stories from Old and New Testaments taken mainly
from the time of the patriarchs and Moses. Among
them are the following:</p>

<p><i>From Old Testament</i>: The Creation and Eden, The
Fall, Cain and Abel, The Flood, The Call of Abraham,
Abraham and Lot, The Birth and Offering of Isaac,
The Marriage of Isaac, Esau and Jacob, Isaac Blessing
His Sons, Jacob's Flight, The Birth and Rearing of
Moses, The Call of Moses, Moses Before Pharaoh, The
Exodus from Egypt.</p>

<p><i>From New Testament</i>: The Birth of Jesus, Jesus'
Entry into Jerusalem, Jesus Suffering in the Garden
of Gethsemane, Jesus' Death on the Cross, The Burial
of Jesus, The Resurrection of Jesus, The Outpouring
of the Holy Ghost. Instruction is exclusively oral.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Historical references are disregarded. Historical situations
are frequently clarified by references to the history
of civilization and geography. New phases of
God's dealings with men and their attitudes toward
Him are singled out and presented for consideration.
Passages of Scripture and others from the catechism
or hymns are treated in connection with the Bible
stories as they are told.</p>

<p><i>Class III.</i> (Six half hour periods weekly.) Biblical
history up to and including the time of Solomon,
characteristic stories from the prophetic period, and
selections of Scripture from the New Testament designated
officially for study in reference to certain
church holidays. Among the topics included we find:
The Tower of Babel, God's Covenant with Abraham,
The Visit of the Three Men, The Lord Visits
Sodom and Gomorrah, Jacob Serving Laban, Jacob's
Return, The Travel to Sinai, The Giving of the Law,
The Unfaithfulness of the People, The Travels from
Sinai to Jordan, The Death of Moses, Joshua Leading
the People into Canaan, Gideon, Ruth, Samuel, Saul
Becomes King, Saul Rejected, God Chooses David to
be King, David and Jonathan, Saul Pursuing David,
The Death of Saul, David Chosen to be King by the
People, The Fall and Restitution of David, Absalom,
The Last Days of David's Life, Solomon, Elias, Jonah,
Daniel. The matter covered in Classes I and II is
again taken up, to which the above is added in historical
connection. To this material Biblical geography and
cultural history are added as needed, while hymns,
passages of Scripture, or selections from the catechism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
are continually used. Through constant reviews the
moral and religious contents from the various sources
are connected into successive groups, each group centering
around the life of some prominent Biblical character.
Instruction is chiefly oral, though some reading from
text is a privilege which may be indulged in as an aid.
A certain amount of catechismal work may be assigned
as home lessons.</p>


<h4><i>Second Division</i></h4>

<p><i>Class IV.</i> (Boys four hours, girls three hours, weekly.)
New Testament history centering in the stories of Jesus'
childhood, His miracles, and His easier parables. New
stories taken up: The Birth of John the Baptist Foretold,
The Birth of Jesus Foretold, The Birth of John
the Baptist, Jesus Presented in the Temple, The Flight
into Egypt, Appearance of John the Baptist, The Baptism
of Jesus, Jesus is Tempted, The First Disciples
Come to Jesus, The Marriage in Cana, Jesus Visits
Nazareth, Jesus Choosing the Twelve Apostles, Jesus
Heals the Centurion's Servant, The Death of John the
Baptist, Jesus Healing the Palsied, Jesus Raising
Jairus' Daughter, The Woman of Canaan, Parable of
the Unmerciful Servant, The Good Samaritan, Jesus
at the House of Martha and Mary, Parables of the Lost
Sheep and the Lost Coin, Parable of the Prodigal Son,
Dives and Lazarus, Healing of the Ten Lepers, Parable
of the Publican and Pharisee, Parable of the Marriage
of the King's Son, Easter, Pentecost. The extent to
which details of stories, Biblical geography, cultural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
history, and passages of Scripture or catechism are included
is governed by the maturity and education of the
children. In this class considerable attention is given
to the reading of hymns and New Testament Scriptures
from the four Gospels (elucidating obscure passages
and difficult sentences), to connections between
Bible stories and history, and to chronological sequence.</p>

<p><i>Class V.</i> (Boys four hours, girls three hours, weekly.)
Continued instruction in New Testament history,
especially the parables of Jesus and the story of his
passion and resurrection. To this is added the account
of the founding of the first Christian church and its
spread by the efforts of the chief apostles. The work
includes the following new stories: Jesus and Nichodemus,
Jesus and the Samaritan Woman, Jesus Commences
to Speak in Parables, The Transfiguration of
Jesus, Peter's Confession, The Man Born Blind, Jesus
the Good Shepherd, The Raising of Lazarus, Jesus in
the House of Zacchaeus, Jesus in Bethany, Parable of
the Labourers in the Vineyard, Parable of the Ten
Virgins, Washing of Feet, The Lord's Supper, Jesus in
Gethsemane, Jesus Before the High Priest and the
Sanhedrin, Jesus Before Pilate and Herod, Crucifixion
of Jesus, Christ's Burial, The Resurrection, Jesus Appears
to the Two Disciples on the Way to Emmaus,
He Appears to the Disciples in Jerusalem, He Appears
at the Sea of Tiberias, The Great Commission to the
Disciples, His Ascension, The Outpouring of the Holy
Ghost on Pentecost, The First Miracle and First Persecution,
Stephen, The Ethiopian Eunuch, Saul, Cornelius,
Paul Preaching the Gospel to the Gentiles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>Bible reading, the catechism, Bible history, and
hymns are studied as in former classes, but more intensively.
Besides the catechism, passages of Scripture,
containing great Christian and moral truths are
to be impressed and memorized verbatim. Continuous
reviews through the years enable the children to
connect several stories into groups, and to acquire complete
information regarding the life and work of Christ.
A small instruction book is used. First part and
Article I of the second part are studied.</p>


<h4><i>Third Division</i></h4>

<p><i>Class VI.</i> (Four hours weekly.) Bible history and
Old Testament taken up simultaneously&mdash;Bible reading
and ecclesiastical history alternating. A deeper
knowledge of sacred history is sought. Striking illustrations
of God's plan of salvation operating among
the Jews are given, designed to enable the children to
appreciate the redemptive meaning of Old Testament
history. Emphasis is placed on the period just preceding
the time of Christ. New stories introduced:
The Division of the Kingdom, Elisha, The Downfall
of the Kingdom of Israel, Isaiah, Jeremiah, The Fall
of the Kingdom of Judah, The Jews under Babylonian
Captivity, Their Return from Captivity, The Last
Four Hundred Years.</p>

<p>Familiarity with Old Testament Scriptures and history,
Biblical geography, and cultural history is to be
gained. Articles II and III of the second part, and
the third, fourth, and fifth parts of the instruction book
are taken up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Class VII.</i> (Three hours weekly.) One Gospel&mdash;Matthew&mdash;is
read connectedly and followed by a treatment
of selected parts from the Acts of the Apostles
in connection with the work of Biblical history in the
fourth and fifth grades. All materials previously
gathered from the various sources are again taken up,
applied, and centered.</p>

<p>Narratives relating to important periods of the
church. Among them:&mdash;The Persecutions (under
Nero, Polycarpus), The Victory of Christianity (Constantine),
The Christian Ceremonies, Augustine, Hermits
and Monks, The Spread of Christianity, The
Popes, The Crusades, The Preparation for the Reformation,
The Lutheran Reformation (Luther, the Jesuits,
the Catholic Mission), The Lutheran Church in the
Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, in the Eighteenth
and Nineteenth Centuries, The Mission, Bible
Societies.</p>

<p>The aim in this division is to give information regarding
the development of the church in general, and
of the Lutheran church in particular. Narratives are
grouped around great central characters&mdash;Christian
personages. A realization of the lofty aims of Christianity
on the part of the children together with an
appreciation of their duties and responsibilities as members
of the Christian church is the intent. By means of
an instruction book the main divisions of church history,
general history, and the history of Norway are
correlated. Information contained in the hymn book
acquaints the children with the ceremonial order of the
ecclesiastical year as well as with the contents and order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
of the book itself. The study of previously memorized
hymns and verses is emphasized and enlarged upon.</p>

<p>It is to be remembered that in Norway church and
state are united. Religious and scholastic interests
are under the direction of the Department of Ecclesiastical
and Educational affairs. The minister of this
department of State is one of the King's cabinet. Here
we find one of the numerous attempts at the solution
of the vexing question of moral instruction, or, to be
more exact, religious instruction in the public schools.
While the provisions for this teaching are not faultless,
and though their course of instruction could not be
adopted for use in America with its medley of religious
prejudices, yet we must acknowledge that they are well
adapted to the needs and desires of the people served.
The citizenship of the country is homogenous religiously,
almost universally Lutheran, and their traditions militate
against any change in religious creed. The teaching
of religion in the schools has been the practice for
generations, the instruction is taken as a matter of
course, and it exerts its beneficient influences upon all.</p>

<p>There are a number of important features of this
moral instruction which press their claims for special
mention, but we cannot discuss them all. A few, however,
demand some attention. The statement of the
proverb, that as the twig is bent so will the tree be inclined,
has been borne out in practice times without
number. Here, it seems to me, is one more illustration.
Throughout their whole school life&mdash;that receptive,
appropriating, formative period&mdash;the children have
constantly before them ideals that are elevating, examples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
that are inspiring, and admonitions that tend to
create and develop within them an ambition to excel
in beauty of character. That the morals of society
are not kept more nearly pure by this procedure seems
a psychological impossibility. Again a rather successful
attempt is made to have the home and school cooperate
along the lines of personal purity. In fact the
home, the school, and the church join hands and supplement
each other in all efforts in religious and moral
training. True it is that striking examples of nobility
of character, high ideals, and moral worth abound in
profane history as well as in sacred, in secular life as
well as in religious, in living characters as truly as in
those of past ages, but the school system of Norway
provides ample opportunity for presenting all of these
things in connection with their regular instruction in
the various subjects taught, and, in addition, furnishes
particularized instruction which makes a specialty
of moral and religious development. It seems imperative
that, when these ennobling lessons are thus vividly
presented, the powers of imitation and habit should combine
in the creation of stronger and nobler characters.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when religious instruction is made a
requirement, it too frequently becomes formal and
literal rather than spiritual and lifegiving. That this
great misfortune is the case in some of the secondary
schools of Norway is an indictment which cannot be
denied. However, in the primary schools the instruction
is fruitful and important. As a consequence of
these conditions the statement is common among many
that in looking back over the years of religious instruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
they recall numerous happy instances of earnest,
heartfelt prayer and Bible stories accompanied by intense
feeling on the part of the teacher. Other experiences
reveal the fact that some of the teaching profession
had not the sincerity and feeling back of their instruction
required in order to give vitality and meaning
to the lessons presented.</p>

<p>The entire question of instruction in morals in our
public schools is one of pressing importance. It is
being agitated in many lands today and a solution is
sorely needed. Were all classes of society united as to
what should be included in this instruction the matter
would adjust itself very readily. However, social conditions
in a single nation are more or less diverse, and
between different nations still greater breaks are to be
found. In fact the ideals and conceptions of society
are so varied that no one present system would suffice
for all. Could a code of ethics be formulated which
would meet universal approval then its adoption and
use might be hoped for. Until then each nation must
necessarily follow the plan which seems best adapted
to its social requirements. As already stated, the people
of Norway are nearly all adherents to the Lutheran
creed so there are very few dissenters from the common
rule. Provision is made in the law that those who do
not adhere to the state church and object to receiving
instruction in this particular line may, upon request of
parent or guardian, be excused from such instruction.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Norwegian</i></h4>

<p><i>Aim.</i> It is the aim of the instruction in Norwegian
to further the mental development of children, especially
their linguistic ability. In this course of activity
they should acquire:</p>

<p>(1) Efficiency in apprehending and assimilating
what they hear or read, confident readiness in reading,
plain articulation, and correct and natural accentuation.</p>

<p>(2) Efficiency in expressing themselves orally and
in writing without making any serious errors in the
common usage of language or the rules of composition.</p>

<p>(3) Efficiency in the use of the grammar of the
mother-tongue which is necessary for the above measure
of attainments.</p>


<h4><i>First Division</i></h4>

<p><i>Class I.</i> (Boys twelve hours, girls eleven hours,
weekly.) A suitable number (twelve or fifteen) of interesting
children's stories are told and utilized for the
special purposes of widening the circle of the children's
imagination and developing in them ability in observation,
conception, and expression. An effort is made to
render the general contents of the stories lucid through
explanations, while the features arousing special interest
in the minds of the pupils are made the objects of more
detailed conversation. An effort is made to train the
children in correct, free, and easy expression in connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
sentences, and to develop in them the ability
to rehearse their stories freely and connectedly.</p>

<p><i>Reading.</i> The aim is ability to read the primer
(<i>ABC-en</i>) with assurance and in a clear tone, properly
articulating and accenting each word and syllable.</p>

<p><i>Written exercises.</i> The object of the written work
is to teach the children to write words and simple sentences
which have just been read orally or have been
seen in the primer or on the blackboard.</p>

<p><i>Class II.</i> (Boys ten hours, girls eight hours, weekly.)
Twenty or thirty of the most interesting and valuable
selections (prose and poetry) contained in the reader
are made the objects of special and thorough treatment.
Comments, questions, elucidating explanations, and
conversations are means employed in securing a vivid
appreciation of the contents and in developing ability
in their easy rehearsal. The other pieces are treated
in a more cursory manner, only the larger views and
the more general understanding of them being attempted.</p>

<p>Special attention is given to having all readings slow
with loud, plain, and correct articulation and proper
accentuation. Habitual mistakes are carefully eliminated.
Story telling is also a feature of the year's
work.</p>

<p><i>Written exercises</i>, made up of sentences and short
parts of readings, conversations, or stories are given
frequently and for short periods. Here the names of
letters and spelling are attended to with great care.</p>

<p><i>Class III.</i> (Boys eight hours, girls seven hours,
weekly.) Twenty or thirty paragraphs from the
reader are given special attention&mdash;the remainder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
cursory. The plan of work is about the same as for
Class II. Considerable attention is given to the rehearsing
of the reading lesson by the pupils. Some
reproductions are to be quite detailed and exact though
they are not to be given in the exact words of the text.
Still other selections receive more general treatment.
A few of the most pleasing poems should be memorized.
Greater readiness in slow and even reading with loud
and clear expression and proper natural accentuation
should be sought.</p>

<p><i>Written exercises.</i> Selections from the language work
giving special and rather extended attention to spelling,
punctuation, and grammatical constructions and
forms. The teacher sets examples of correct punctuation,
etc.</p>


<h4><i>Second Division</i></h4>

<p><i>Class IV.</i> (Five hours weekly.) A select number
(20-30) of pieces from the reader treated as in the former
classes, though more exhaustively; and, in addition,
quite a wide range of selections chosen for more cursory
reading. A considerable amount of information
regarding the topics treated and explanations of literary
expressions should form important parts of the instruction
in this class. Here, as in both preceding and succeeding
classes, it should be the aim to have the children
make their meanings plain when conversing upon
the selections read, at least to the degree of their ability
and development. Parts of former conversations on
various topics should also be recalled and woven into
their discussions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Written exercises.</i> These shall include features previously
studied, and introduce more detailed and finer
discriminations in grammatical usages and forms.</p>

<p><i>Class V.</i> (Boys four hours, girls five hours, weekly.)
Exhaustive study of a few selections and cursory reading
in large quantities as before. Careful and abundant
training in oral expression. Specific and detailed rehearsal
of topics discussed in which an increasing amount
of knowledge gained through study, experience, and
thought is utilized. Short stories are read. Poems
are memorized. Progress in clear and distinct articulation
and easy and natural emphasis in harmony with
refined speech is continuously a requirement.</p>

<p><i>Written exercises.</i> A continuation of former exercises
and a considerable amount of copying, or the writing
of abstracts of lesson content, especially during the
second half year. Orthographic, grammatical, and
rhetorical forms are entered into more exhaustively
and their niceties urged. Through continued practice
in preparing and writing compositions, extra work in
copying, and special study of orthography and punctuation,
the children, by the close of this their fifth year of
schooling, should be quite capable in punctuation as
well as spelling, though they should not be expected to
spell and punctuate independently with accuracy.</p>


<h4><i>Third Division</i></h4>

<p><i>Class VI.</i> (Boys five hours, girls six hours, weekly.)
Reading from a selected portion of the reader. Conversations,
information, explanations, and linguistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
elucidations are to be entered into according to necessity.
Increasing stress is here laid on the work of drawing
out the thoughts, ideas, and knowledge of the pupils,
and of inciting them to more independent, intellectual
effort.</p>

<p><i>Written exercises.</i> Continued as previously though
introducing larger amounts of independently selected
forms of expression and insisting on greater accuracy
in punctuation. Letter writing is added.</p>

<p><i>Class VII.</i> (Five hours weekly.) Selections from
the reader and supplementary reading from recommended
books calculated to awaken, develop, and educate.
Special attention given to the most important authors.</p>

<p><i>Written exercises.</i> Compositions on topics of interest,
letter writing, business correspondence including
applications, invoices, advertisements, and telegrams.</p>

<p>The methods employed in presenting the mother-tongue
are quite plainly set forth in the foregoing outline.
Though the content is not so specifically defined,
the general lines are indicated in such a way as to give
very adequate insight thereinto. Some of the methods
of presentation seem somewhat cumbersome and rather
antiquated. This impression is due chiefly to terminology.
The actual work in the schoolrooms is
flexible, free, and, as a rule, attractive. The latitude
granted to the teachers in all their work admits of almost
unlimited individual initiative. Many of their teachers
are quite expert in the most modern methods.</p>

<p>The utilitarian idea which pervades every phase of
their school work is especially noticeable in the teaching
of their own language. In harmony with this idea, let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
me call attention to the fact that, from the first, constant
use is made of every attainment in both oral and written
form. The oral work embraces the reading of the text,
reading from the blackboard, and conversational exercises
on the special topics being considered. Written
work on the same lessons include copying of certain
selections or parts of them and original expressions
in regard to the contents of lessons read. In the advanced
grades these written exercises become more and
more extended and complicated until they amount to
complete essays. Special attention is given to correct
forms of expression and to the acquirement of habits
of clear and distinct enunciation. The child, who from
his earliest school days becomes habituated to exact
pronunciations, is very liable&mdash;almost sure&mdash;to spell
correctly; and, when constant use is made of the language
in written exercises, the accepted and approved
forms of expression become the fixed usages.</p>

<p>Now their treatment of the mother-tongue is a combination
of our reading, spelling, language lessons,
grammar, rhetoric, and literature, all taught in their
natural order as they arise through actual use. Incidentally,
vast amounts of biography, history, geography,
and natural science as well as writing are included.
The richness of content and thoroughness of
treatment deserve careful consideration in the writing
of courses and still more in their application. Specialization
in phases of a single subject in lower schools
nearly always means waste of energy, scattering of
forces, and disappointment in the end. On the contrary,
unification and close correlation result in economy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
of time and effort, and issue in more worthy attainments.
The several fields of thought are already too
much isolated from each other, and unless some guards
are erected the individual fields also will be broken up
and their distinctive phases so divorced from one another
that their cooperative tendencies and values will
become void and their relationships will be lost sight
of. Norwegian is easily the preponderant study in
Norway's schools, but, since it is so inclusive, it probably
deserves the large amount of time devoted to it.</p>

<p>The long lists of supplementary readings now provided
in our American schools exert a wholesome influence.
Their constant revision and extension furnish
materials which in the hands of skilled teachers,
guarantee to the pupils sure knowledge and ability in
the use of the mother-tongue. The limitless resources
in English literature, America's lavish provision for
higher education and professional training, and the
freedom granted to our teaching profession leave the
teachers of our language without excuse. The pupils
studying English in America have a right to expect the
best. One condition which frequently militates against
first class work in this line is that school boards all too
frequently fail to realize that being a teacher of English
means more than merely hearing lessons so many times
a week. A very large part of the most important work
must be done aside from class exercises. If there be
any teacher justified in asking a reduction in hours
of instruction it is the teacher of the mother-tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>


<h4><i>Mathematics</i></h4>

<p><i>Aim.</i> Readiness in the four mathematical operations
in whole numbers, decimal numbers, and simple fractions,
written and oral. Ability to independently solve
various examples in the forms in which they generally
appear in practical life, also examples in proportion and
examples in percentage, together with problems of
planes and solids. Course and mode of its execution
as given in a text&mdash;Instruction in Mathematics
(<i>Regneundervisningen</i>)&mdash;followed
in all essentials.</p>


<h4><i>First Division</i></h4>

<p><i>Class I.</i> (Boys five hours, girls four hours, weekly.)
Through constant use of illustrative material (objects
about the room, wooden pins, cubes, the children's
fingers, etc.) the children are taught to gradually become
acquainted with the numbers to ten, twenty,
thirty, and on up to one hundred; and they are afforded
continuous practice in reading, writing, and explaining
the numbers, as well as in performing simple solutions
in the four arithmetical operations. At the close
of the year the children should be able to count to one
hundred forward and backward. They must know how
to manipulate the numbers from one to ten in adding
to or subtracting from any number less than one hundred,
and be able, by the assistance of the tables, to
answer questions in multiplication (two's to five's).
and some questions in division. Chief importance attaches
to the ability of the children to use the numbers
from one to thirty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Class II.</i> (Four hours weekly.) Acquaintance with
and ability to read and write any number up to one
million.</p>

<p><i>Mental arithmetic.</i> Continuation of operations begun
in Class I. When proficient in adding and subtracting
units to and from one hundred, tens and units
are taken up in the same way. Examples in easy
multiplication, with occasional use of division, carried
on throughout the year.</p>

<p><i>Tablet work.</i> Addition and subtraction of numbers
up to one million. In the operations coin, measure,
and weight denominations are used, and are illustrated
by coins, measures, and weights.</p>

<p><i>Class III.</i> (Boys four hours, girls three hours,
weekly.) Acquaintance with the numeral system up
to and including millions. Continuous practice in
reading, writing, and using numbers.</p>

<p><i>Mental operations.</i> Addition and subtraction of numbers
up to one hundred continued. Thereafter extend
the numbers as far as the children can use them with
certainty and rapidity. Multiplication of numbers up
to one hundred by units.</p>

<p><i>Tablet work.</i> More work in addition and subtraction
going farther than to numbers with six ciphers.
Multiplication of numbers with many ciphers by multipliers
having one or more ciphers.</p>


<h4><i>Second Division</i></h4>

<p><i>Class IV.</i> (Boys four hours, girls three hours,
weekly.) Division with divisors having one or more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
ciphers. Separation of numbers into their individual
factors. Finding of the least common multiple. After
this a thorough drill in the four arithmetical operations
with whole numbers&mdash;old and new exercises.</p>

<p><i>Mental and tablet exercises</i> in closest relation to each
other. In all mental operations, here or later, rapid
and positive use should be made of the easier examples
before the harder ones are fumbled or handled with uncertainty.</p>

<p><i>Class V.</i> (Two hours weekly.) After the necessary
preparation, practice in the three operations with decimal
numbers. In connection with the consideration of
plane surfaces the children should be given practice
in measuring parallelograms, triangles, irregular quadrangles
and many-sided surfaces&mdash;triangles should predominate.</p>

<p><i>Mental and tablet exercises</i> parallel each other and are
in intimate relation.</p>


<h4><i>Third Division</i></h4>

<p><i>Class VI.</i> (Three hours weekly.) Preparatory practice
in common fractions together with addition and
subtraction of fractions having a common denominator
and others which can easily be reduced to a common
denominator. Multiplication and division using or
including fractions. Further development with mental
operations growing out of and in connection with
tablet work.</p>

<p><i>Class VII.</i> (Three hours weekly.) Percentage including
interest, rebate, and discount. The calculating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
of cubes, prisms, pyramids, circles, cylinders, cones;
also shortened pyramids, cones, and cylinders.</p>

<p>After this a general review so far as time admits.</p>

<p>Simple arithmetical operations occupy the entire
field during the earlier years. The elementary algebraic
forms and methods of solution are introduced relatively
early, and minor geometric relations and operations
are presented during the last (seventh) year of the
lower schools. These latter features are radically
different from our general procedure in the United
States. We are in the habit of presenting the various
mathematical subjects one at a time, completing one
before another is considered to any extent whatever.
For example, arithmetic is taken up and gone through,
while parts of geometry and algebra which would be
great aids in some of the arithmetical solutions are
studiously avoided or excluded until the formal study
of that particular subject is finally begun. The people
of Norway, on the contrary, enter the larger field of
mathematics and, in a more rational manner&mdash;a more
psychological way&mdash;utilize available processes and forms
at every opportunity. The phases of mathematics
are not specialized into isolation but coordinated into
a working unity. Instead of studying one subject
throughout its intricacies and side issues before admitting
consideration of other phases of mathematics,
they make it the rule to utilize the elemental factors of
the various mathematical subjects in every way possible.
They give recognition to the simpler and more
fundamental principles and operations regardless of
the special phase of the subject to which they belong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
and use the entire product as groundwork for succeeding
steps in the science. In this way parts of algebra and
geometry become valuable contributing preliminaries
to higher arithmetical operations.</p>

<p>The texts used by the pupils are little more than
a series of exercises. All teaching is done by the teacher
and the texts are arranged in such a way that the children
may have opportunity to become skilled in the
principles evolved in class through application of them
in the long lists of problems in their texts. Very little
blackboard is provided for the pupils' use, hence but
little blackboard work is accomplished. Each room
has a small board on which the teacher of a pupil may
go through solutions. Never have I seen more than
one at a time working at the blackboard. While the
limited use of blackboards generally calls for an increased
amount of dependence upon intellectual activity
and consequent increase in mental alertness, the free
use of blackboards relieves the mind of unnecessary
burdens which may as well be borne by crayon, and
thus provides for the higher centers a freer activity in
pushing on the quest for the unknown.</p>


<h4><i>Geography</i></h4>

<p><i>Aim.</i> To obtain (1) A somewhat complete acquaintance
with the fatherland; its conditions, commerce,
manner of life. (2) Acquaintance with the
geography of Europe, especially the countries to the
north and the other longer civilized countries. (3) A
view of the different continents and a closer acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
with lands and places which are of greatest importance
to the fatherland. (4) Knowledge of the
most important features of physical and mathematical
geography.</p>


<h4><i>First Division</i></h4>

<p><i>Class II.</i> (Boys three hours, girls two hours, weekly.)
With continuous reference to local geography and
places known to the children, the pupils are brought to
understand geographical forms and relations in general.
Special attention is given to charts and maps. Instruction
begins with drawings (on blackboard and tablets)
of the schoolroom; then extends to schoolgrounds,
to the immediate surroundings with streets and some
of the more important buildings; and then to the entire
city with its environs, etc., etc. The children should
become acquainted with the more important features
of topography, soil, valleys, plains, ridges, mountains,
seas, fjords, rivers, brooks, seasons, day and night,
rising and setting of planets (sun, moon, and stars),
flora and fauna, altitude, sea level, etc. From familiarity
with the city and its surroundings the work extends
to the entire fatherland which is considered in
an elementary fashion. Herein are included elementary
studies of coast line, principal systems of valleys,
and location and size of cities.</p>

<p>Map drawing of small localities.</p>

<p><i>Class III.</i> (Two hours weekly.) The map of
Europe. Beginning with the fatherland, including its
location with reference to other lands and seas as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
as its relations thereto, enter into a study of other
European countries in the order in which they would
naturally be entered if touring from the fatherland.
Subdivisions of the sea and land, also cities, railways,
canals, rivers, and mountains are to be studied. Pictures
are to be used in illustration. By the use of globes
and other illustrative material, the discussion may be
extended to other parts of the world. Each of the several
divisions of the earth is to be treated in an elementary
manner. Everything is to be outlined or indicated
on the maps and charts&mdash;first by the teacher and later
by the pupils.</p>


<h4><i>Second Division</i></h4>

<p><i>Class IV.</i> (One hour weekly.) On the foundation
of what was done in Class III the work shall be extended
to the outlying divisions of Europe&mdash;Norway, Sweden,
Denmark, The British Isles, France, Spain, Portugal,
Italy, Russia. The study of maps is emphasized both
for review and new work. Every land is considered
with reference to the fatherland, other known lands,
the equator, and the poles. Attention confined to
typical aspects: description of a typical city, a manufacturing
center, etc., special variations in climate,
flora and fauna, chief natural scenery, commercial
activities, products and conditions of the citizens.
Readings on geographical topics are correlated with
picture illustrations. Details and illustrations utilized
as in Class III.</p>

<p><i>Class V.</i> (One hour weekly.) Holland, Belgium,
Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Balkan peninsula are considered after the plan used
in Class IV. After these European countries, foreign
countries are discussed. Study and instruction in this
class is in accord with the outlines of work in previous
classes though more exhaustive and minute. India,
China, the large islands in the Pacific Ocean, North
Africa with its Sahara, Central Africa, The United
States of America, Australia, etc., are also considered.</p>


<h4><i>Third Division</i></h4>

<p><i>Class VI.</i> (One hour weekly.) The geography of
the fatherland is gone through thoroughly with the aim
of imparting to the children a rather complete knowledge
of their country's nature, commerce, and life in
its various localities. The chief points considered are:
coast line, surface, water channels, climate&mdash;east and
west&mdash;boundaries, inhabitants, life of the people, political
divisions. This is to be constantly correlated
with what has been learned previously of other European
countries. Map drawing in detail. Review of former
work.</p>

<p><i>Class VII.</i> (One hour weekly.) The more important
features of mathematical and physical geography
are presented, being continuously illustrated by charts,
maps, globes, astronomical plates, etc. The horizon,
earth formations, zones, yearly and daily rotations,
geographical breadth and length; the moon, its phases;
the planets, etc., are important topics for study.
Others are positions of continents and oceans with
reference to each other, climate and physical features<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
of the earth, the air, winds, changes in temperature,
movements of the sea, the more important ocean
streams (Gulf and Polar streams), etc. Throughout
the study constant connections should be made between
what is known in geography, natural history, and
nature study.</p>

<p>The outline indicates both thoroughness and a close
correlation with related fields of work. Beginning
with the well-known in geography they gradually widen
their horizon and establish connections with the more
remote parts of the earth until the children obtain a
moderately accurate appreciation and knowledge of
this branch of study and get a view of its intricate relations
with life and human activity. While the work
of the course is generally characterized by thoroughness,
their study of localities outside of Europe is simply
a skimming over or a skipping glance.</p>

<p>To be sure time is insufficient to enable them to exhaust
all opportunities; but, it would seem more consistent
with their general idea of concentrating on
matters which directly concern the fatherland and its
subjects, did they bring the young into a more intimate
acquaintance with America and a fuller appreciation
of what America really means to Norway and Norwegians.
Very few Norsemen are without vital interests
here. Nearly all, it seems, have immediate
relatives or very dear friends who have migrated from
the native land and have established homes in the
United States. It appears that it would be important
for them to follow the path of their migrating brethren
and acquaint themselves more fully with the geography<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
of America. Its life, topography, commerce, and other
distinctive features would add to their geography a
chapter of unsurpassed values.</p>

<p>The work which is done is commendable for many
reasons. The many-sided views obtained by varied
methods of attack are rich and meaningful. Every
pupil is ready with a full discussion in response to a
question relating to their own country. Furthermore,
they are informed with reference to the relationships
existing between each country studied and the fatherland.
These have been clearly pointed out. The
perspective obtained through the study of physical
and mathematical geography affords richer meaning
to every day of life as well as to all the phenomena of
nature.</p>


<h4><i>History</i></h4>

<p><i>Aim.</i> The chief aim of instruction in history is to
inspire the children's historic instincts and love for
their country and people. In an effort to obtain this
the following information is imparted: (1) A somewhat
connected knowledge of the history of the fatherland
together with the fundamental tendencies of the
social order. (2) Acquaintance with the most significant
incidents in general history.</p>


<h4><i>First Division</i></h4>

<p><i>Class III.</i> (Two hours weekly.) Selected narratives
from the history of the fatherland. The collection
of stories includes the following: Harald the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
Fair Haired, Haakon the Good, Haakon Jarl, Olaf
Trygveson, Olaf the Holy, Sverre Sigurdson, Haaken
the Aged, Margaret and Albert, Christian the Second,
Christian the Fourth, Tordenskjold, The Years 1807-1814,
The Time of Pirates, Kristian August, Norway
in 1814, Kristian Fredrik, Eidsvold, 17th of May, Norway's
decennial celebration.</p>

<p>The stories are presented orally and are so detailed
that the children get clear pictures of persons and incidents.
The material of instruction is centered about
particular and important persons and incidents in
order to give them greater fixity. The pupils rehearse
the stories they have been taught. Historic poems
and songs of the fatherland which refer especially to
people or incidents are studied in connection with the
history. The material received through instruction
in geography during the former year is utilized as
groundwork in building up and enriching the historical
ideas of the fatherland. The more important phases
of social institutions are presented in a way suited to
the capacity of the pupils. As the stories proceed, an
attempt is made to awaken a degree of appreciation of
their historical sequence.</p>


<h4><i>Second Division</i></h4>

<p><i>Class IV.</i> (Two hours weekly.) Stories and descriptions
regarding general history centering about
the following points or topics: Ancient world kingdoms,
Greeks, Romans, Germans, Norse, Papacy,
great discoveries and inventions. Treatment here is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
similar to that given in Class III. Stories, anecdotes
and pictures add life to regular routine. Stories of
the fatherland are presented in very brief form and are
given in order to effect connection with general events
in world history. Here again geography is made the
groundwork of history.</p>

<p><i>Class V.</i> (One hour weekly.) Work carried on as
previously. Narratives of events chiefly during the
time from the Reformation to the French Revolution.</p>

<p>Central features studied: Luther and the time of
the Reformation (Luther's childhood and youth, Karl
V., extension of the Reformation, and the Thirty
Years' War), the period of absolute monarchy, the time
preceding the Revolution, science and discovery. Presentation
of topics the same as previously given. Here
is included also a considerable amount of culture history,
descriptions from which are given in such a way
that life among the higher classes, as well as among the
oppressed, may be presented and appreciated.</p>


<h4><i>Third Division</i></h4>

<p><i>Class VI.</i> (One hour weekly.) Work continued as
heretofore. Stories from the time of the Revolution
down to modern times. Among the materials used
are the following topics: time of the Revolution, 1789-1800;
Napoleon, 1800-1815; July and February Revolutions,
Napoleon III., Germany's consolidation, discoveries
and inventions, delineations of the history of
civilization, and the advance of modern times in industries
and means for communication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Class VII.</i> (Two hours weekly.) The history of
the fatherland gone through in great detail and in a
definitely connected manner. All work based upon
what has been learned in former classes. The following
are among the more important points considered:
Norway in ancient times, Norway organized into a
Christian kingdom, Norway's time of prosperity, Norway
under internal wars, Norway under later kings of
Swedish family and descent, Norway in union with
Sweden and Denmark, Norway united to Denmark
until 1661, time of absolute monarchy (1661-1814), Norway
in 1814, Norway since 1814. In addition, the chief
features of social institutions, the condition of the
state, rights and obligations of citizens, state administration,
communal affairs, and similar topics are discussed
at some length.</p>

<p>By the assistance of a suitable text the presentation
should impart to the pupils a moderately connected
knowledge of the historical development of the fatherland
up to the present time. The children should obtain
clear insight into the inner historic situations;
persons, events, and specific dates standing as contributors
in the background. Historic sagas and related
selections are used in connection. While attention
centers in the history of the fatherland, important
contemporary events in general history are kept constantly
before the eyes, frequent reference being made
to the studies in Classes IV-VI.</p>

<p>The stated aims, enumerated means, and outlined
methods of presentation afford a fairly good idea of the
work done in the study of history throughout the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
primary schools. It has been observed, perhaps by
many, that instruction in history has been preceded by
one year's study of geography, that the geography of
the several countries precedes the history of the peoples
inhabiting them, and that geographical appreciation
is utilized as a foundation for instruction in history.</p>

<p>The main purposes of instruction in history are: development
of patriotic and loyal citizens, intellectual
training, and cultural information. The prized traits
of citizenship are read, sung, and drilled into the daily
life of every child in the entire country, and these impressions
are fixed so definitely that they live through
generations, even when the subjects are transplanted
to foreign soils.</p>

<p>Story telling in the beginnings of history instruction
affords an immediate appeal both to the children's interest
in personal activities and to their liking for that
form of instruction. The characters whose biographies
are delineated are the men around whom national
activities have centered. The bits of history related
are of epoch-making incidents from the earliest times
down to the present. Being presented through biography
they have a personal touch and flavor which
secure vital and immediate responses from the children.</p>

<p>There are still other features worthy of consideration.
Incidents of historic interest are not only pointed out
and studied but the scenes of these are actually visited.
Here again we see the definite way in which history and
geography are correlated. Too, since Norway has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
favored by the gift of many literary geniuses, most
historic characters and events have found place in
literary classics. All along the way, songs, poems, and
dramas having relation to national history are brought
into the instruction in a living, real way. The children
are given abundant opportunity to attain proficiency
in relating historic events with information gained from
the fields of geography, language, and literature.</p>


<h4><i>Nature Study</i></h4>

<p><i>Aim.</i> Instruction in nature study attempts to
awaken the children's interest in and regard for nature
in all its expressions, and to exercise their thought
powers and judgment so as to enable them to find or
make connections between cause and effect. In order
that their attention be centered upon the suitability to
purpose, conformity to law, harmony and beauty, the
children should have their thought directed to nature's
creation and maintenance. Finally, the children
through this instruction should obtain a conception
of how mankind attempts to control nature and to
utilize its strength in the promotion of human welfare.</p>

<p><i>Materials for instruction.</i> Our bodily structure in
the large or whole, as necessary to an understanding of
the general conditions in man's physical life and as fundamental
to instruction in health. The more important
native and foreign animals and plants; their growth and
life, together with their importance in nature's economy.
The natural forces which have greatest significance for
organic life and for man's efficiency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Methods of instruction.</i> Natural objects or representations
of them in model or drawing, and operations
of natural forces illustrated by experiments observed
and written up. The accuracy of observations are
tested by the pupil's oral or written accounts of what
they see. Conditions and things familiar to the children
in common life are the ones to be used above all
others.</p>

<p><i>Class IV.</i> (One hour weekly.) Short synopsis
over our bodily structure (four hours). Present by
oral instruction and through illustrative materials the
skeleton, muscles, digestive organs, skin, circulation,
respiratory organs. The same points may also be
studied as they appear in the lower animals.</p>

<p><i>Mammals.</i> (Twenty hours.) Horse, ass, cow, sheep,
goat, reindeer, deer, elk, camel, cat, wild-cat, lion,
tiger, dog, wolf, fox, marten, bear, swine, elephant,
seal, whale, hare, rabbit, squirrel, rat, beaver, anteater,
bat, monkey.</p>

<p><i>Fowls.</i> (Ten hours.) Tame chickens, woodcock,
sparrow, yellow hammer, bullfinch, lark, swallow, starling,
dove, cuckoo, parrot, hawk, falcon, eagle, owl,
heron, stork, duck, goose, swan, gull, ostrich, and others.</p>

<p>Instruction begins with typical animal forms which
are illustrated by charts or drawings when the stuffed
or mounted specimens are not at hand. The children
are required to depend upon themselves as much as
possible in finding out individual characteristics in the
bodily structures of the chosen forms. Then bodily
structure and habits are related, as are also their homes,
food, color, and environment. Finally, the animal's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
meaning in the economy of nature and its value to
man are the points studied. Along with the careful
study of a typical form, related animals are examined
in a more general and cursory manner. The children
are taught to remember that while they have dominion
over the animals they are at the same time under obligations
to them. Disregard of these duties is looked upon
as rudeness. Animal stories form a part of the instruction.
After studying the chosen types a review
takes notice of common characters and separates animals
into classes. Instruction is based on a text.</p>

<p><i>Class V.</i> (Two hours weekly.) <i>Plants.</i> (Forty
hours.) <i>Dicotyledonous plants.</i> Bluebells, buttercups,
strawberry, apple trees, pea, clover, beans, cherry,

the points concerning the nourishment and respiration
of plants and animals.</p>

<p>The outline in nature study impresses one with the
inclusiveness of the course. The elementary phases of
animal life, plant life, physics, chemistry, and human
physiology and health are made the objects of careful
consideration. True this study in some cases is stiff,
formal, meaningless, and without spirit because of not
being connected with the vital interests of the pupils,
but on the whole the work is brought very close home
to their daily life. Through it the children are able to
see the contributions to life and human welfare made
by the innumerable things in man's environment.</p>

<p>Throughout the primary grades the work is mostly
devoted to descriptive studies. Considerable attention
is given also to the intrinsic value to man of animals,
plants, and natural forces, and the means he has
found for utilizing them in his struggle forward. The
nature lessons throughout the grades are enriched and
enlivened by the use of well selected and carefully prepared
appliances and models for demonstration.
Whenever possible the living animals and plants in
their natural habitat, forces as applied in the machinery
of neighboring institutions, and minerals in
their successive processes of development and refinement
are studied at first hand. Every school where the
financial stringency is not too keen is provided with a
liberal amount of apparatus for demonstrational purposes
(<i>anskuelsesmidler</i>). As an instance, every primary
school in the city of Christiania has at least one room
of considerable size devoted exclusively to the storing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
of this material. Maps, charts, mounted specimens,
plates, preserved articles, and accessory materials are
there in abundance, and provide minute representations
for most any point one might wish to make typical
for illustration or study. The more genuine phases
of laboratory work are not provided, though a considerable
amount of crude experimentation is done in the
grades.</p>

<p>The teacher presenting this course must be capable
for he is the authority and guide back of all work done.
Text books (good ones though condensed) play a part,
but a much smaller part than would be the case in our
American schools were similar instruction approached
in a formal way. In other words, their teachers furnish
the course and <i>teach</i> the subject, while too many of
ours merely present the course provided in the adopted
text book.</p>

<p>Writing, drawing, vocal music, manual training, and
gymnastics are also in the curriculum and each receives
careful attention. Perhaps extended outlining of these
courses and long discussions concerning them are unnecessary.
Their importance and value are recognized.
Their presentation in the schools of Norway is commendable,
but some things must be passed without exhaustive
treatment. Only general statements will be
given.</p>

<p>The results in some lines&mdash;writing and drawing in
particular&mdash;do not justify the amount of time devoted
to them. The writing is mechanical throughout, and
in the lower grade the requirements are altogether
too exacting. Drawing is required of all alike. Those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
who have ability in this line of work perhaps receive
too little instruction; others, without talent or liking
for it, regard it as a drudgery and, in the minds of some
of their teachers, hinder the progress of the gifted. The
finer coordinations required in both writing and drawing
are frequently in advance of the development of the
pupils and work injury rather than benefit.</p>

<p>Vocal music is required of all and injures none.
Probably each one reaps considerable benefit from the
instruction. The class of music used in their teaching
is very different from what is in vogue in our American
schools. The church has exercised a great deal of influence
in this respect. Since church and state are
united the music of the church forms a predominating
portion of the music of the state schools. Psalms,
chants, and songs of stately dignity constitute the bulk
of their selections, while those of lighter strain are interspersed
at intervals not too close together. In
America our children's songs are more attractive from
the "jingle" point of view. Our children like them
better and are more anxious to sing them. The little
Norwegians, too, are delighted when permitted to swing
into the lighter strains of music. They love to sing.
Their faces fairly glow as their mellow voices swell out
whether they sing in a jingle or in the rich harmonies
of their psalms. Common use of the better quality
of music cultivates their ability to appreciate and to
render works of higher order than one usually finds in
the schools of our own country.</p>

<p>Manual and industrial training has had an important
place in their schools for many years. Every hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
spent at the bench is a delight to the boys, while the
girls enjoy equally well the privilege of sewing or cooking.
These activities are certainly valuable in the
training of the young, and their influences extend into
the homes of all the pupils.</p>

<p>Gymnastics is the regular order for all pupils. A
Swedish system of exercises is used which requires little
apparatus but yields large returns. Abundant well-directed
exercises of various kinds are provided for
every pupil at stated periods and are entered into with
zest. The regularity with which the gymnastic exercises
are given doubtless has much to do in preserving
the health of the children. As a class they are not
only free from weaknesses but are vigorous and robust.
Another part of their gymnastic work is the outdoor
exercise which is required of all the pupils between the
class periods. This doubtless adds much life and animation
to the entire school program.</p>

<p>The course as a whole includes the fundamentals and
chief essentials to educational activity. Those who
pass through the primary schools obtain an intelligent
appreciation of life and its meanings. They are able
to meet common needs successfully and to attend to general
affairs in an approved manner. The masses feel
the necessity of the fuller life thus provided and in
turn the school is admirably fitted to the task of developing
loyal and capable citizens. Furthermore,
those who are so favorably situated that they may continue
in school longer than seven years and desire fitness
for entrance upon the work of higher education<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
find in the primary schools every opportunity to gratify
their desires.</p>

<p>The connection between the lower and higher schools
was not at all satisfactory until 1896, when the Storthing
readjusted the system. Since then pupils may pass
regularly from the fifth grade of the primary school into
the four year middle school, or after the completion
of the seven grades of the primary school they may enter
either a three or a four year middle school and finish
in three years. Since the number desiring entrance to
the middle school from the fifth grade is larger than can
be accommodated, those of highest ranking educationally
are admitted. While the secondary school men
claim perfect right to choose the fittest for entrance into
their schools, the primary school men feel that their
work in the sixth and seventh grades suffers injustice
as a result of this selective process. The connection
between the schools is not yet perfect and some unrest
is evidenced in reference to the matter. The chief
need seems to be an increase in the number of middle
schools.</p>


<h4>III. THE MIDDLE SCHOOL</h4>

<p>The Storthing, in 1896, passed a law defining the
limits and work of the middle school. According to
the enactment this school builds upon the foundation
laid in the primary school and secures to the pupils
a thorough general education suited to the needs and
receptivity of childhood. The course of study offered
may be of varied length, but in no case shall it exceed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
four years in duration. The four year course aims at a
very natural connection with the work done during the
first five years in the common school. Where the connection
can be made with the work of later grades in
the primary school, the course of the middle school may
be correspondingly shorter. The aim and methods are
in general similar to those in the lower school; though,
of course, higher, more thorough and inclusive, and
such as give deeper insight into all subjects of instruction.
It is required that instruction be given in religion,
Norwegian, German, English, history, geography,
natural science, mathematics, writing, drawing, manual
training, and vocal music. Instruction in domestic
economy may be provided for the girls.</p>

<p>Formerly all of these schools charged tuition; but, as
the conditions in the commune gradually improved,
provisions were made in some of them for the issuance
of a certain number of free scholarships. These were
usually governed in such a way that those most in
need were the first to receive the benefits. From time
to time scholarship funds were increased until now some
communes provide free scholarships to all resident children.
The city of Christiania has a three-year middle
school building upon the foundation of seven years of
primary work and charging no tuition whatsoever.
This provision together with the building up of scholarship
funds are forerunners of free entrance, probably,
to all of the state's middle schools. As already stated,
the work of the middle school overlaps in part that of the
primary school. The course of study for Classes I and
II is in a large measure a duplication of that provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
for Classes VI and VII in the lower school. However,
to present the work of the middle school adequately,
it is essential that the course for the entire four years be
here included. The state adopts a curriculum which is
used in all of its secondary schools. Minor details
such as texts vary in the different schools. The following
is an outline of the curriculum used in the
Christiania Cathedral School.</p>


<h4><i>Religion</i></h4>

<p><i>Class I.</i> (Two hours.) Vogt's Bible History to the
fall of the Kingdom of Judah. J. Sverdrup's Commentary
to Article 2. Verses of hymns once each
week.</p>

<p><i>Class II.</i> (Two hours.) Vogt's Bible History from
"The Exile" to "The Story of the Passion." Commentary
from Article 2 to "The Sacraments." Verses
from hymns.</p>

<p><i>Class III.</i> (Two hours.) Bible History and Commentary
completed and reviewed. Verses from hymns.
Bible reading.</p>

<p><i>Class IV.</i> (One hour.) Y. Brun and Th. Caspari's
Church History gone through and reviewed. Cursory
study of the ecclesiastical year and the order of divine
service.</p>

<p>Here we note the beginnings of a more formal consideration
of religion. A large part of the work is
historical. Texts and lectures covering practically
identical grounds form the basis of the work in this
branch of study. The change to the more formal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
study of religion strikes the writer as a distinctive turn
or transfer from moderately successful to useless endeavor.
The personal touch and human flavor attending
the informal telling of Bible stories afford some
genuine inspiration. Life touches life. When character
is exemplified in a living person or is shown
through story once to have had expression in a fellow
mortal, interest is awakened and the child instinctively
imitates the vision before him. He transforms it into
life. He enters into the spirit of the theme and the
spirit giveth life.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when religion is presented in a
formal way, when an abstract view is taken, when the
core of the subject is in the cold pages of texts,&mdash;then
the letter killeth. Through force of habit the children
retain some respect for the wishes of the teacher and
do go through the motions of study and recitation, but
the life of the subject is very soon extinguished and
even respect for it vanishes in large measure. However,
in rare instances good results are obtained through
the efforts of teachers who are especially well qualified
for this work.</p>


<h4><i>The Mother-Tongue and Old Norse</i></h4>

<p><i>Class I.</i> (Five hours.) Pauss and Lassen's Reader
II. 2. Some of the Songs of the Fatherland learned
by heart. Oral and written analysis. Hofgaard's
Norwegian School Grammar, Paragraphs 1-31, 34-38,
41, 45, 48-59, 61, 65, 76-79. The more important part
of Hougen's Rules for Correct Writing. Written work
(dictation and composition) each week.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Class II.</i> (Four hours.) Pauss and Lassen's Reader
II. 3. Poems&mdash;among them some of the Songs of the
Fatherland learned by heart. Hofgaard's Grammar
continued, also analyses. One written exercise each
week (dictation and easy composition.)</p>

<p><i>Class III.</i> (Alternately three and four hours.)
Pauss and Lassen's Reader III. Poems learned by
heart&mdash;partly from Lassen's Poems for Middle Schools,
partly from Songs of the Fatherland. Certain parts
of the grammar reviewed. Analyses now and then.
About twenty written exercises, among them some
dictations.</p>

<p><i>Class IV.</i> (alternating three and four hours.)
Pauss and Lassen's Reader III. That portion from
which the examination is taken, gone through and
partly reviewed. Several poems committed to memory.
Fourteen written exercises. Among the topics
used the following are typical: The summer vacation,
the location of our city, Denmark, past and present
lighting systems, animal life in our forests, reminiscences
from my earlier school days, birds and why we
protect them, the Norsemen as seamen, Christiania
in winter garb, Europe's natural conditions in preference
to those of other continents.</p>

<p>In harmony with the indications of the plan of instruction,
the early part of the work in the study of
the mother-tongue is devoted to reading from selected
texts. Simultaneously, grammar and rhetoric are
carried along and put into use in written compositions
which are frequent. Here, as in the primary schools,
exact spelling, correct grammatical and rhetorical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
forms, and approved literary style are constant requirements.
The child is expected not only to read intelligently,
but to express himself orally and in writing
in a comprehensive manner and in such form as to appeal
to the intelligence of others. Thus both in oral
speech and through written composition the pupil
is privileged to put his attainments into continuous
use. They acquire the tools of thought and skill in
handling them.</p>


<h4><i>German</i></h4>

<p><i>Class I.</i> (Six hours.) Knudsen and Kristiansen's
Reader from the beginning to the "Subjunctive."
Written exercises.</p>

<p><i>Class II.</i> (Five hours.) Knudsen and Kristiansen's
Reader from "Subjunctive" to close of book. Voss'
Reader in section A, seventy-six pages, in section B,
fifty pages; one-half of these shall be learned by heart.
Hofgaard's Short German Grammar the most important
forms. Written exercises. Rehearsals. Retroversions.</p>

<p><i>Class III.</i> (Five hours.) Voss' Reader, in section A,
seventy-five pages, in section B, fifty-eight. Hofgaard's
Short German Grammar, inflections. In section
B besides the above, paragraphs 140-148, 156, 169,
179-181. In addition section B shall have thirty-six
pages of O. Kristiansen's oral exercises and thirty-two
compositions according to O. Kristiansen's exercises
in written work. In section A, written exercises,
partly according to Kristiansen's outlines for written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
work and partly reviews of the lessons in the reading
book.</p>

<p><i>Class IV.</i> (Five hours.) Voss' Reader in section
A, twenty pages, in section B, seventy-five. Repetition
of the portion designated for minutest study. The
grammar reviewed. One or two written exercises each
week according to Kristiansen's outlines.</p>

<p>The instruction in German proceeds in a very natural
manner. The earlier lessons are devoted very largely to
oral instruction in which the teacher takes the lead.
Words, phrases, and sentences are given by the teacher
for translation and concert repetition. Repetition and
concert work are prominent in many places in the schools,
but nowhere stressed to the same extent as in their
language instruction. Concert work seems to stimulate
to freedom in pronunciation, while repetition affords
the drill which is necessary to the required accuracy.
Having had at least five years of thorough
instruction in the mother-tongue the children are able
to appreciate in a measure the meaning and importance
of verb forms and other features of inflection so that
they are ready to do consistent work in this phase of
their study. In addition to the translations referred
to, conversational exercises are soon introduced, and
at the end of the second year some facility in easy conversation
is evidenced. Toward the close of the middle
school the children are able to read the language with
ease and to converse in it quite fluently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>


<h4><i>English</i></h4>

<p><i>Class II.</i> (Five hours.) Brekke's Elementary
Reader to page seventy-four, studied and reviewed,
besides the grammar in the back of the book. Conversational
exercises and written work on the blackboard.
During the last half year an occasional written exercise
in a book.</p>

<p><i>Class III.</i> (Five hours.) Brekke's Reader for the
Middle School, sixty-five pages read and reviewed.
Knap's Grammar. One narrative per week.</p>

<p><i>Class IV.</i> (Five hours.) Brekke's Reader for the
Middle School. Required portion read and reviewed,
while the remainder of the book is gone through and
in part read <i>ex tempore</i>. One narrative each week.</p>

<p>The study of English proceeds along lines parallel
to those followed in the German. The learning of the
language is accomplished chiefly through its use. Explanations
are made by using the more familiar words
of the tongue studied, by circumlocutions, and by other
similar practices. Grammar is resorted to as a means
rather than an end. It is used only in facilitating the
acquisition of the language, not as an end in itself.
However, at the close of the course each pupil has become
quite proficient in the grammar as well as in reading
the language and in conversing in it.</p>


<h4><i>History</i></h4>

<p><i>Class I.</i> (Three hours.) Nissen's History of the
World by Sehjoth, from the beginning until "Scandinavia
in the Middle Ages."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Class II.</i> (Two hours.) Text as in Class I. From
"Scandinavia in the Middle Ages" to "Modern Times."</p>

<p><i>Class III.</i> (Three hours.) Same Text. From
"Charles V" to "The February Revolution." Review.</p>

<p><i>Class IV.</i> (Three hours.) Same Text. Reviewed
in its entirety.</p>

<p>The course in history is very rich and its study is
entered into with animation. The teacher is usually
a master in the subject and he makes the work of great
profit. A considerable amount of the class period is
devoted to a vivid and analytic introduction of the
work to be done at the next meeting of the class, preparation
for which shall be made in the meantime.
Problems are presented and purposes are indicated so
that the preparatory study may be done with some definite
end in view.</p>

<p>All facts of history are placed in appropriate settings
and perspective, correlated into a unity, and given vital
meaning. Maps, charts, and pictorial illustrations
are provided in abundance and used constantly.
Frequently historic scenes near at hand or known to
the pupils are pointed out, minutely described, and
visited.</p>

<p>Teachers appeal to the sentiment of pupils with the
aim of begetting loyalty for the fatherland in the
hearts and minds of the young. I have heard instructors
grow eloquent as they warmed up on phases of
Norway's history, and have noted the flushed cheeks
and snapping eyes of the children that bespoke the
national pride of the young hearts as familiar words,
slogans, and songs of their heroes were quoted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>When given an opportunity&mdash;a common occurrence&mdash;the
pupils enter into the rehearsal of historic events with
enthusiasm. Every mind in the room is active. They
are awake to the situations and are familiar with the
scenes and literature connected with the several stages
of development. Replies given in response to questions
from the teacher are nearly always in the form of narratives,
sometimes occupying ten or fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>General history or history of any foreign country is
entered into in a spirit similar to that characterizing
the consideration of their own. On one occasion I
listened to a review on American history. Among the
characters taken up were Grant, Lee, Harriet Beecher
Stowe, and Lincoln. The pupils discussed Uncle Tom's
Cabin with familiarity, Lee was considered as "The
Napoleon of America," but Lincoln was the one to whom
most of the class period was devoted. At the close of
the hour the teacher announced a lecture on "Abraham
Lincoln" for the following Sunday evening in the
Working-Men's College (<i>Arbeiderakademi</i>)<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> of which
he was the director. This incident illustrates the way
in which they correlate the work of different educational
organizations, and shows their interest in the
important events connected with the history of other
nations.</p>


<h4><i>Geography</i></h4>

<p><i>Class I.</i> (Two hours.) Arstal's Geography. Norway
and Sweden. Review.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Class II.</i> (Two hours.) Arstal's Geography. From
"The Central European Mountains and Rivers" to
"Asia." Studied and reviewed.</p>

<p><i>Class III.</i> (Two hours.) Arstal's Geography. The
foreign continents. Studied and reviewed.</p>

<p><i>Class IV.</i> (Two hours.) Arstal's Geography. Repeated
or reviewed in its entirety.</p>

<p>Two books are used in the study of this subject.
One is made up entirely of well designed, carefully
drawn, and thoroughly reliable maps, printed on a good
quality of paper. The other is a text giving a good
logical statement of what the course is calculated to
include. The teacher must provide the major portion
of the information by his own initiative and through
cooperation of pupils. Illustrative material (<i>Anskuelsesmidler</i>)
is provided in great abundance and in diversified
variety.</p>

<p>An effort is made to impart to the pupils a satisfactory
appreciation of the conditions prevailing in the
countries considered. Their colonization, commerce,
products, topography, political subdivisions, cities,
population, river and mountain systems, climate, etc.,
are all carefully studied. The course begins with the
geography of Norway. Next foreign lands and conditions
are taken up and compared to situations at
home. When the various countries on the globe have
been kept for a time before the eyes, a thorough review
is given which occupies the greater portion of the
last year in the middle school course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>


<h4><i>Mathematics</i></h4>

<p><i>Class I.</i> (Five hours.) Numbers resolved into factors.
Fractions. Some Proportion.</p>

<p><i>Class II.</i> (Five hours.) Algebra: Bonnevie and
Eliassen's text. From beginning to division. Geometry:
Bonnevie and Eliassen's text. From beginning
to right lines divided into equal parts. Arithmetic:
Proportion and percentage.</p>

<p><i>Class III.</i> (Five hours.) Algebra: Bonnevie and
Eliassen's text. From division to equations with two
unknowns. Geometry: Bonnevie's text. From parallelograms
to Book IV. Drill in percentage and interest.</p>

<p><i>Class IV.</i> (Five hours.) Algebra: Bonnevie and
Eliassen's text. From equations with two unknowns
to close of book. Geometry: Bonnevie's text. From
Book IV to close of text. Review of entire text.
Drill in computing solids and other miscellaneous
problems. A few hours devoted to bookkeeping.</p>

<p>One of the most favorable features of their instruction
in mathematics is the intimate connection they
make between the several phases of the subject. Arithmetic,
algebra, and geometry are never wholly separated
from each other. They are in reality interwoven and
so definitely correlated that each contributes to the
others. By constant use the several processes become
familiar tools in the mental activities of the pupils.
Mastery of the principles of the science and ability in
their use are the ends to be attained. The outline of
the course indicates the extent of the field receiving attention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
It is sufficient to say that the topics are all
made to appear plain, definite, and vital; and that they
are assimilated, and do become parts of the growing
life.</p>


<h4><i>Nature Study (Natural Science)</i></h4>

<p><i>Class I.</i> (Three hours.) Botany: Sorensen's text.
Written descriptions of about twenty-five plant forms.
Zoology: Vertebrates according to Sorensen's text.</p>

<p><i>Class II.</i> (Two hours.) Botany: Sorensen's text.
From "The Sunflower Family" to "Plant Structure."
Plant analysis. Zoology: Sorensen's text. "Invertebrates."
Review from treatise on insects to close of
book.</p>

<p><i>Class III.</i> (Two hours.) Zoology and botany reviewed.
Plant analysis. Henrichsen's Physics. From
beginning to "Properties of Air."</p>

<p><i>Class IV.</i> (Three hours.) Henrichsen's Physics
studied through and reviewed with related laboratory
work. Knudsen and Falch's The Human Body I
studied and reviewed.</p>

<p>The plan of work, as noted, includes botany, zoology,
physics, and human physiology. Each subject is taken
up and pursued in a consistent manner. In botany
plant analysis and structure form the important part
of the work. A herbarium is made by each pupil.
The study is brought very definitely into the daily lives
of the children with the intent of opening their eyes to
the conditions in nature about them and of developing
in them an appreciation of the almost unlimited provision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
made for man's welfare. Zoology and physiology
are treated in a similar way. They are calculated
to enrich the life of the individual by bringing
him into more sympathetic relations with all living
forms. In physics the child does some experimental
work and thereby gets first hand experience to accompany,
clarify, and assist in evaluating the elaborated
instruction of the teacher regarding forces, phenomena,
and laws.</p>

<p>It was interesting to note in a recitation chiefly devoted
to experimental work that the language used in
conversation was carefully scrutinized and that errors
were corrected. Throughout the curriculum a very definite
effort is made to utilize every phase of information
possessed by the pupils.</p>


<h4>IV. GYMNASIUM</h4>

<h4><i>Religion</i></h4>

<p><i>Class I.</i> (One hour.) Selected hymns, and chapters
from the prophet Isaiah.</p>

<p><i>Class II.</i> (One hour.) Short survey of church history.
Brandrud's text used by some of the pupils.</p>

<p><i>Class III.</i> (Two hours.) Short presentation of the
Christian faith and ethics, without text. Survey of
designated portions of John's Gospel, the Epistle to
the Romans, and Revelations.</p>

<p>The instruction in religion is commonly given by the
city pastors. While all of these men are highly educated,
many of them lack the ability to awaken the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
minds of the pupils to an active interest in the subject.
No examination in religion is required in the gymnasium.
As a result of the formality in this teaching and the
lack of incentives generally, the members of the classes
are listless and inattentive. I insert a note that I
made in reference to one class in which I was a visitor.
"Most of the class was listless all of the time and all
of them most of the time." I have on a few occasions
heard short and irrelevant remarks made by pupils
in response to direct questions by the instructor, and
among the pupils it is accounted no reflection whatever
if any of their number states that he knows nothing regarding
the situation under discussion. The work appears
altogether void of interest and without profit.</p>

<p>It seems almost pathetic that a subject of such importance
should have its richness of content dissipated
and wasted through lack of incentives or by reason of
unsuccessful methods of presentation. My observation
of the work from the beginning of the primary
school through all the classes up to the completion of
the gymnasium convinces me that the personal and concrete
presentations in the lower grades are very successful
but that the formal, authoritative work in the secondary
schools is little more than failure.</p>


<h4><i>Norwegian</i></h4>

<p><i>Class I.</i> A and B (Four hours.) Pauss and Lassen's
Reader IV. 1. Njael's saga. Holberg's The Busybodies

in Iceland about the year one thousand; a characteristic
of the "Busybodies" by Holberg; Christiania
as a city of manufacture and industry; a comparison
between the east and west of Norway with references
to nature and commerce; a painting I like; Norway as
a tourist land; do not put off until tomorrow what you
can do today; why could not the Persians conquer
the Greeks; the dark sides of city life; what circumstances
have combined in giving the Norsemen high ranking
as seamen?</p>

<p><i>Class II.</i> R. G. (Five hours.) History of Literature
through the literature of the North, folk songs, a
collection of Danish and Norwegian ballads, selections
from Asbjornsen, Moe, and Holberg. Romance poetry,
some read minutely and the rest cursorily. Consideration
of Aasen and the Landsmaal movement. Sixty
pages of Garborg and Mortenson's Landsmaal. About
twenty pages of Old Norse from Nygaard's beginner's
book.</p>

<p>Written exercises, frequently on topics of interest.
Besides all this each pupil must give a discussion on a
self-selected theme before the class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Class II.</i> L-H. (Six and five hours.) Holberg's
Erasmus Montanus. Wessel's <i>Kjaerlighed uden
Stromper</i> (Love without Stockings.) History of literature
to about one thousand, eight hundred. Shakespeare's

songs.) Old Norse: Nygaard's beginner's book.
Some pages from Thor to Utgard. Twelve written
exercises on important literary, historical, and industrial
subjects.</p>

<p><i>Class III.</i> R. G. (Four hours.) History of literature
from Holberg down to the present. Read scrutinizingly
selected writings of Holberg, Ohlenschlager, Wergeland,
Welhaven, Asbjornsen and Ibsen. In the Landsmaal
read from Garborg and Mortenson's Reader and
the writings of Vinje. In the Old Norse read the remainder
of Nygaard's beginner's book. History of
language and history of literature. Many written
exercises, largely literary and historical topics.</p>

<p><i>Class III.</i> L-H. (Five and four hours.) Special
study of selections specified as examination material
including the writings of Holberg, Wergeland, and Welhaven.
Landsmaal from Garborg and Mortenson's
Reader. History of Literature. History of Language.
Twelve written compositions on important topics.</p>

<p>The work in literature throughout the gymnasium
deals with the masterpieces of the language in an analytic
and critical way. The aims are to familiarize the
pupils with the best productions in the language, to
acquaint them with the lives and historical relations
of their authors, and to develop literary appreciation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
and style. Accordingly many writers are included,
translations of world classics are utilized, history of
literature in its connections with general history receives
attention, and ability in composition is encouraged and
required.</p>

<p>Eddas, sagas, and the more important productions
from successive periods are studied in minute detail.
The Landsmaal is not neglected. When any piece of
literature is under discussion, related historical events;
references to other literary productions, characters,
myths, etc.; the life of the author; and many other important
points are considered exhaustively. The intricacies
of the language are sought out in patience and
made familiar. Every known device for completing
the literary background is utilized. Since the literature
of the country is a part of the life of its citizens, no
effort is required to secure intense interest in the work.</p>

<p>In the linguistic-historical course more time is devoted
to this branch of instruction than is given to it
in the <i>real</i> and Latin courses. The quality or class
of work is essentially the same though the quantity
is necessarily less in the two latter courses. A definite
effort is made to place each pupil in possession of the culture
represented in the national literature.</p>


<h4><i>German</i></h4>

<p><i>Class I.</i> A and B (Three hours.) Gundersen's
German for the Gymnasiums. A, sixty-seven pages, B,
seventy-five pages, consisting of the following titles:
<i>Die Sanger</i>, <i>Die Burgschaft</i>, <i>Der Ring des Polykrates</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
<i>Der Handschuh</i>, <i>Die Sonne Bringt es an den Tag</i>, <i>Die
Goldene Repetieruhr</i>, <i>Wie der Meisenseppe Gestorben ist</i>,
<i>Umzingelt</i>, <i>Der Stumme Ratsherr</i>, <i>Zur Geschichte des
30-jahrigen Krieges</i>, <i>Landsknecht and Soldat</i>. In B
review the more important features of syntax in O.
Kristiansen's Grammatical Exercises.</p>

<p>Once every week a written review of a lesson read.</p>

<p><i>Class II.</i> (Three hours.) Gundersen's German for
Gymnasiums, about one hundred pages. Fifteen written
exercises, partly reproductions of new matter and
partly write-ups of what has been studied. In <i>real</i>
gymnasium some supplementary assignments in addition
(<i>Das Schneeschuhlaufen</i>, <i>Die Lage Kristianias</i>, etc.)</p>

<p><i>Class III.</i> (Alternating three and four hours.)
Gundersen's German for Gymnasiums. Reading finished
and the greater part of it reviewed. Every
second week a written review covering two consecutive
hours.</p>

<p>German is recognized as the language of a great
neighbor nation and is assiduously studied. Much
time has been spent in the middle school in acquiring
the language and now three years are used in introducing
the pupils into the thought-life and culture of the nation
through the inner contact of its literature. Some
of Germany's more important authors are studied rather
exhaustively. An endeavor is also put forth to become
familiar with the most remarkable events in the history
of that Empire. Through this advanced treatment
they perfect their knowledge of the language as such,
and further their ability to converse in the foreign
tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>


<h4><i>French</i></h4>

<p><i>Class I.</i> A (Four hours.) After the more important
parts of phonology, Hermanstorff and Wallem's
Reader in French for the Gymnasium I. pp. 18-108.
The most essential parts of the grammar, together with
many exercises in translation. While reviewing, special
emphasis is placed upon reading exercises.</p>

<p><i>Class I.</i> B (Four hours.) Hermanstorff and Wallem's
Reader I pp. 1-55 read and reviewed, together
with the corresponding translations from Norwegian p.
109 ff. In addition pages 98-108 are read and reviewed
and most of the remaining exercises are gone through
cursorily. Wallem's Vocabulary Part I. 1 and Part
V. 6-9 are studied.</p>

<p><i>Class II.</i> R. G. (Two hours.) Hermanstorff and
Wallem's Reader II pp. 1-31 and 104-112. Grammar
drill by references to synopses of grammar in the beginner's
book. Wallem's Vocabulary Part I. 1 and
V. 6-10 studied and reviewed.</p>

<p><i>Class II.</i> Lang. (With Latin five hours, without
Latin four hours.) Hermanstorff and Wallem's Reader.
Division without Latin about eighty pages, consisting
of Part I., the last section and Part II selections for A,
I-VI for B, III, IV, VII, XI. Division with Latin,
the same amount excepting B, VII and XI. Wallem's
Vocabulary, review V. 6-9.</p>

<p><i>Class III.</i> R. G. (Two hours.) Hermanstorff and
Wallem's Reader, about eighty pages.</p>

<p><i>Class III.</i> Lang. (Three hours.) Hermanstorff and
Wallem's Reader I, the last section and II for A, I-X<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
and for B, I-XIII with the exception of a few selections
such as X in A which is read only cursorily. As exercise
in <i>ex tempore</i> translation use Duruy's History of
France.</p>

<p>About the same amount of French is taken in the
Latin as in the <i>real</i> course of study though it is carried
but for two years in the former and three in the latter.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
More time is provided for it in the linguistic-historical
course then in either of the others. Reference to the
table on page 171 will indicate exactly the amount of
time used and its distribution throughout the years.</p>

<p>The French language is not as closely related to the
Norwegian as are the German and English. Greater
variations are noted both in pronunciation and in
vocabulary. Almost universally the Norwegians regard
it as the most difficult of the three foreign languages
to acquire.</p>

<p>The study of French is not begun until the pupils
enter the gymnasium when they are fourteen or fifteen
years old. English and German are begun three and
four years before French. The teachers believe that a
mistake is made in not beginning the study of French
earlier. It is worthy of note that the Norwegian pedagogues
who have tried beginning instruction in the
languages at different times in the school course are
definitely of the opinion that to begin the study of a
foreign language early is a distinct advantage. It
seems to the writer that American schools might profit
by this experience and introduce the study of languages
in the lower grades.</p>

Review of selections from which examinations are taken.</p>

<p>The connections the Norwegians sustain with the
English speaking world are, perhaps, stronger than those
binding them to any other people. Norway has close
commercial associations with both England and
America, and rarely does one find a family in Norway
without near relatives in one or both countries. As a
consequence, more than usual interest attaches to the
study of English. Strenuous efforts are now being
made to introduce it into the curriculum of the elementary
school, and such change will probably be effected
at an early date.</p>

<p>According to the present plan those who graduate
from the gymnasium have studied English six or seven
years and have gained a fairly definite knowledge of it.
They are able to read fluently and converse with ease.
They have become familiar also with much of the best
English literature, and through it have been brought
into close touch with the life and culture of the English
speaking peoples.</p>

teachers who appeal to the interests of the pupils
through related history and literature, and through
promise of linguistic excellence. The work is gone into
thoroughly, drill is constant, and readiness in response
is demanded.</p>

<p>Despite the excellent quality of instruction there is a
general feeling among the Norwegians that the study of
Latin does not yield the immediate and substantial
returns coming from other kinds of study. While they
recognize that for advanced work in certain lines Latin
is a prerequisite, they are convinced that, outside of
those special lines of learning, contemporary tongues,
history, biology, industrial chemistry, and other scientific
subjects are more beneficial. As a consequence this
branch of study is on the decline.</p>

<p>The study of history in the gymnasium builds very
definitely upon the foundations laid in the primary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
and middle schools. The supposition is that the pupils
are by this time capable of getting from texts the information
they contain.</p>

<p>The class periods are devoted partially to texts of
lesson preparation, but mostly to free discussion and to
presentation of relevant material by the instructor.
Bits of information regarding the private life of historical
characters, minor incidents in their careers, and
varied personal touches given by the teacher infuse
spirit and vitality into the entire course. The lessons
are brought directly home to the pupils and they are
able to appreciate the fact that they are inheritors
of past accomplishments and participants in present
activities. Some of the most interesting and enthusiastic
recitations I visited were in history.</p>

<p>All through the course in history Norway is given
first attention and consideration. Its history is begun
first, all along it is made the center around which the
history of other nations is grouped, and finally it is
given the concentrated, mature, and crowning efforts
of those pursuing the long course of instruction. The
closing year is generally devoted to a study of social and
political conditions in the fatherland. Norway's constitution
with its many provisions and administrative
features of government (general and local) is given to
the youths in clear, concrete, and concise presentations.
Upon leaving the gymnasium the young people, therefore,
are in a position to appreciate the meaning, privileges,
and responsibilities of citizenship. While they
have their affections centered in their native land, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
are able to comprehend the relative accomplishments,
standing, and conditions of other countries.</p>

Review all requirements.</p>

<p>The gymnasial course in geography includes physical
geography, astronomy, and political geography. It
is rich and profitable. Under the head of physical
geography are included such topics as physiography,
petrography, dynamic geology, history of the world's
development, the earth's surface, oceanography, and
the atmosphere. While only a general survey of the
respective fields is possible, the pupils obtain a pretty
fair grasp of fundamentals and feel that they have a
very good and adequate idea of what their home&mdash;the
earth&mdash;really is.</p>

<p>The work in astronomy or mathematical geography,
as it is frequently called, is concerned chiefly with the
earth's place in the universe, the Copernican system,
Keppler's laws, the moon, the earth (form, size, and
motion), the celestial world in general, the sun's apparent
motion, the sun as a measurer of time, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Political geography provides acquaintance with the
earth in special reference to man's presence and welfare.
It treats of his means of livelihood, ways of communication,
and the conditions under which he colonizes,
builds up cities, and develops generally.</p>

<p>In addition to completing the work begun in the
middle school in arithmetic, algebra, and geometry;
instruction in the gymnasium includes trigonometry,
stereometry, analytical geometry, and higher arithmetical
series. The methods of instruction are the
same as those used in the middle school though, of
course, adapted to the greater maturity and stronger
mentality of the pupils. By the time pupils enter the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
gymnasium considerable ability should have been
gained in working independently. Where necessary,
the teacher cooperates in solving problems and makes
sure that the principles involved are thoroughly understood.</p>

<p>Frequently during the recitation period several members
of the class are called to the blackboard, one at a
time, to perform operations under consideration. As
the pupil develops the problem he explains every step
taken as he proceeds. The other pupils observe closely,
take notes, and offer suggestions. The instructor carefully
supervises every move, giving explanations when
necessary not permitting erasures or leaving any operation
until all in the class understand fully. In this
way hearty cooperation is secured. Every mind is
actively engaged and the excellent results testify of the
validity of the method.</p>

<p>Work in analytical geometry and higher arithmetical
series is taken only by those in the <i>real</i> course of instruction.</p>

<p>Natural Science or Nature Study in the earlier years
of school life is less differentiated than it becomes in the
gymnasium. Here we find the fields very definitely
separated. The more important chemical laws, animal
and vegetable development and growth (botany and
zoology), and the more essential features of human
physiology and hygiene form centers of attention
throughout the three years. In the <i>real</i> course physics
also is stressed, though in the other courses of study
little time is provided for it.</p>

<p>Not as much is made of the laboratory method as
seems advisable. While every school has some provision
for it they do not go at it in real earnest. Only
one or two at a time can do first hand work. The
others cooperate mentally and get some benefit, but
they cannot reap the greater results which immediate
individual experimentation yields.</p>

<p>One day during the progress of a lesson in zoology
(where I was a visitor) a supply of live specimens arrived
from the marine biological station at Drobak, and
the remaining portion of the hour was devoted to investigations
at close range. Interest was intense.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Pupils dipped in (literally) and investigated at their own
pleasure quite informally. The material was soon
divided up into several receptacles, and around each
of these gathered an eager group in an effort to use,
handle, and examine every specimen. Those who had
no interfering appointments for the succeeding hour
accounted it a great favor to be privileged to continue
this study for an extra class period. This is but one
illustration of the interest attending laboratory work
where each pupil may handle and examine for himself&mdash;where
he may be a doer, an active participant instead of
merely an observer.</p>

<h2><i>Chapter IV</i></h2>

<h3>INTERPRETATIVE CONCLUSIONS</h3>


<p>This chapter is for the consideration of some of
the more important phases of the school system
presented in greater detail in the foregoing
chapters. The aim is to bring some features of
Norway's system under close inspection, to interpret
them in the light of commonly accepted pedagogical principles,
to make comparisons between them and our own,
and to suggest possible improvements where they seem to
be needed. It is clearly evident that school practices admirably
adapted to the social conditions in one country
may be far from desirable in another. On the other hand,
it is well-known that some educational means may be
equally suitable in more than one country. Furthermore,
certain fundamental principles are effectual wherever
education is attempted. We shall hope to find
some things worthy of being adopted bodily by us and
others capable of transformation into shapes calculated
to improve our educational practices.</p>


<h4>THE PEOPLE AND THEIR IDEALS</h4>

<p>The Norse are a sturdy race having potentialities capable
of great accomplishment when once aroused and
rightly directed. Conditions prevented these capacities
from functioning with freedom until the middle of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
last century when the store of energy which had accumulated
during preceding decades and centuries asserted
itself and effected a rapid rise in the political and intellectual
status of the nation.</p>

<p>It is believed that Norway is now in a period of transition
from a condition of mediocrity to one of eminence
among the nations of the world. Politically, ethically,
and educationally she assumes larger proportions daily.</p>

<p>As individuals the Norwegians are recognized among
the leaders in literature, art, and science, and equal to
any as pioneers in the development of the rich frontiers.
As citizens they are enthusiastically welcomed everywhere.
Climatic conditions and habits of life have
given them the sturdiness of physique and vigor of
mind which make them fearless and undaunted in the
face of great undertakings and critical situations. They
have become habituated to overcoming all obstacles
in their way, and they naturally concentrate their energies
for the achievement of their desired ends.</p>

<p>It is reasonable to expect similar traits in them as a
nation. Their past actions declare these same tendencies
and their present attitudes confirm the observer
in the belief that the history of Norway will continue
the story of regular and ever higher development. Their
strongly democratic individuality seems to have been a
factor in enabling them to realize and recognize their
self in a very successful way. Matters of importance
put the entire state into action and it ploughs through
to the bottom of things. While very conservative, the
state will not permit precedent to stand in the way
of accepting new conditions when they are proven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
superior to the old. After thorough examination of
every detail it passes judgment on the situation and
then stands on that solution. Conservation has been
an operating principle with them all along the line. A
step in advance, some worthy achievement, new or
loftier ideals, greater political freedom, and the like
when once gained are always retained.</p>

<p>The union of church and state for example has been
to their advantage. Matters of religion and politics
were handled by the same hands and as a consequence
both were strengthened. Each found in the other
sources of inspiration and power. They both recognized
education as a necessary fundamental means for
their preservation and advancement. Acting in the
main on the educational ideals of Martin Luther the
church accepted the chief responsibilities in the direction
of school activities, while the state very cheerfully
undertook the burden of their support. Through the
processes of growth direct responsibilities have been
more and more shifted to the state, though the church
continues to exert very strong influence and render
every possible assistance.</p>

<p>Resulting from this cooperative activity a system of
education has evolved which is effectual in the improvement
of the state and in the maintenance of the noblest
ideals of the church. According to its design this system
of schools qualifies all children in the land for intelligent
citizenship, and prepares them severally for
the performance of every function of state, the service
of the church, and for the various arts, professions, and
other occupations of life. In other words, Norway provides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
for her children educational advantages suitable
to every legitimate requirement or desire. Thus its
school system develops a loyal, well-trained citizenship
capable of maintaining its highest ideals and eager to
cooperate in moving the fatherland forward into greater
and nobler achievement.</p>


<h4>FACILITIES FOR EDUCATION</h4>

<p>To satisfy the varied requirements of the nation along
the line of educational facilities it has been necessary to
establish a complex system of diversified schools. Fundamental
in the system are the <i>primary schools</i> providing
the thorough elementary training so essential and effectual
in the qualifying of citizens. Following these are the
<i>secondary schools</i>&mdash;middle school and gymnasium&mdash;which
afford the advantages of higher education along the
more liberal lines. Besides these are the many institutions&mdash;public
and private&mdash;for technical and professional
study. There are general technical schools,
schools of trades and manual arts, agricultural and
horticultural institutions, naval and military academies,
schools of art, teachers' colleges, a technical high school&mdash;an
engineering college and institute of technology of
high rank&mdash;in the city of Trondhjem, and the Royal
Frederik University in Christiania which is devoted to
specialized study and research in science, letters, and
learned professions, including theology, law, medicine,
and education. The last is provided for in the affiliated
Pedagogical Seminary recently established.</p>

<p>At this point we may speak a word in commendation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
of the important part played by private institutions in
Norway. Among them may be enumerated primary
and secondary schools, teachers' seminaries, and technical
institutes. Being of high merit and operating side
by side with the state schools, they have rendered valuable
service and exerted a wholesome influence. The
state has recognized their work and expressed its appreciation
of their efforts by giving them standing and by
voting annuities to certain of them.</p>

<p>The uniformly high standard of preparation required
for entrance to and the close correlation between the
several special schools make easy the passage from one
to another when it is desired, and give solidarity and
unity wherein cooperation is natural and mutually
beneficial.</p>

<p>It should be noted that provision is made for the
proper care of the exceptional child in Norway. This is
more particularly true of the defective. The child who
is dull of comprehension along some lines receives individual
assistance from his regular teacher or another
who is employed to do the work. Recognition is given
to disparity in physiological and mental age of children.
Those who are definitely lacking in mentality are segregated
into classes in the large schools and into separate
schools in the larger cities, where they are provided
with abundant, well-selected equipment and expert
teachers who exert every effort to improve the conditions
and to overcome the handicaps of the unfortunates.
Morally delinquent children are placed in
children's homes&mdash;homes for correction&mdash;where they
are supervised and taught. Each child is placed under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
the conditions best suited to his needs&mdash;where he will
be most profited. All of this work comes under the
authority of the school officials, and as a result there is
close coordination between the regular and the special
schools.</p>

<p>Not only do these officials care for the mentally and
morally delinquent but they are also authorized and
required to take children from environments that are
likely to develop evil and lawless traits. Unfit parents
may be deprived of the control and authority over their
offspring who are taken and placed in private homes of
moral influence or in children's homes where they receive
proper care and training. Being vested with
such authority the school officials are able to do much
toward the prevention of delinquency as well as to attend
specifically to the individual cases where a lack
of moral responsibility is evidenced.</p>

<p>Here are wholesome lessons for our American schools.
Instead of giving sufficient individual help or providing
expert teachers for the less intelligent, we permit them
to become repeaters or to drop out altogether; in place
of taking the child from an evil environment before he
becomes a moral delinquent and placing him under
moral surroundings in some good home, we hesitate
to interfere with parental rights&mdash;as though they were
greater than social&mdash;and permit him to become a law-breaker;
and rather than give to school officials the
authority and necessary equipment to care rightfully
for the child who has committed some error, we place
him in the hands of the law and he is probably sent to
a reformatory having neither facility for his proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
treatment nor any connection with the schools whatsoever.</p>

<p>Closer co-ordination of these educational functions
and institutions would prevent much misfortune, cure
a vast amount of misery, and accomplish more efficient
results.</p>


<h4>DIRECTING AUTHORITY AND MANAGEMENT OF SCHOOLS</h4>

<p>Norway's educational authority is definitely centralized
in the person at the head of the Department of Ecclesiastical
and Educational Affairs, who is a member of
the King's cabinet. The several departments, bureaus,
commissions, and boards for control are radiations
from this central focus. Furthermore, their schools
are parts and parcels of one very definite, though
somewhat complex, system; each class of schools, in
its respective field, is ordered according to certain
specifications; and all are coordinated so as to result
in a unified whole without overlapping, or exposure
of ragged and loose ends.</p>

<p>The controlling features of greater importance such
as curriculum, appointment of teachers, plans of
instruction, and the determination of qualifications
for teaching positions are in the hands of the higher
authorities. In effect the state determines the policies,
the officers are expected to respect them, and the
patrons exercise but little direct control. For example,
the law provides that completion of certain grades of
school work shall mean practically the same throughout
the country, that the middle school and gymnasium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
examinations shall be uniform everywhere in the
state, that standards of academic fitness for teaching
positions must be the same, and that teachers' salaries
shall not be below a certain minimum amount.
Local opinion never has a thought of departing from
these requirements.</p>

<p>Being vested with considerable authority the
school officials are able not only to make suggestions
and recommendations, but also to enforce all school
regulations. This plan is successful in securing the
most efficient service of which the officials are capable.
They are expected to pursue their duties and perform
their obligations according to directions without being
too largely influenced by the opinions of individuals
or community sentiment. Local politics plays a very
small part in determining what shall be the educational
trend, though the patrons of the school do
enjoy considerable liberty and bear some responsibilities
in arranging minor factors with reference to local
situations.</p>

<p>We Americans might avoid a vast amount of
leakage and unnecessary expenditure by improved
organization of our educational institutions. A unified
system of education, manned by competent officials
with some authority, might easily raise the standard
of efficiency of our schools several grades, and at the
same time reduce the proportional cost. President
Hall has given optimistic expression along this line.
He writes:&mdash;"The time is not far off when we shall
coordinate all educational agencies for all classes of
children of school age.... All... institutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
for the care and betterment of the bodies,
minds or morals of children should correlate their
work so that eventually it may all become so consolidated
that each child can be placed in that position
in the whole great system which will do most and
best for it at each stage and so that changes from one
to the other can be made whenever it becomes for the
welfare of the child.... Diversities of agencies,
aims and method should increase; and incorrigibles,
defectives, homeless, neglected, backward children and
the rest should each have special provision; but integration
should keep pace with this differentiation."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Were our public schools, reformatories, schools
for defectives, etc., etc., all combined into one system
they might perform their offices more effectively than
they do now. Instead of permitting each to run along
independent of the rest, they should be made to supplement
each other.</p>

<p>Again, it is a matter of common knowledge that
in our own country high school graduation, qualifications
for teaching positions in the several grades of
school work, college entrance requirements, college
degrees, etc., are without uniform standardization. At
present even a college degree has meaning only when
the work and equipment of the institution granting
it have been carefully estimated; state teachers' certificates
may or may not be valid in other states; and
reciprocity among the states in recognizing certificates
is not in operation generally. While state certificates
are not always demanded, some of the states are now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
requiring that all teachers in the high schools must
be college graduates. In all too many instances the
only effectual prerequisite to obtaining a position as
teacher in the schools&mdash;primary or secondary&mdash;is the
vote of the school directors. The gradation of educational
activity according to a fixed basis and the raising
of standards in academic and pedagogical preparation
and in personal fitness for teaching positions
would make the schools vastly greater factors in the
country's progress and do the nation an inestimable
service.</p>

<p>Centralization and uniformity in authority and
purpose are distinctly evident in every school activity
in Norway. The authority of the state is clearly
stamped on the work of every official from the directing
head to the last in position. Everyone connected
with the system feels the obligations of the position
occupied and, at the same time, recognizes his own
security while keeping within the limits of the law.
They all concentrate their energies in an earnest endeavor
to realize the ends which the educational system
is designed to reach. Even individual subjects
of instruction are presented for specific purposes which
in turn contribute to the general end to be reached
through the course of study as a whole. Purposes,
aims, and ends are always in the foreground of attention,
and when teacher and pupils cooperate and are
actuated by common ideals, their efforts are sure to
be vital and successful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>


<h4>TEACHERS' TRAINING</h4>

<p>Proper pedagogical training is perhaps the
most potent factor for good in educational activity.
But few systems, if any, adequately meet
the needs along this line. Some are well supplied
with institutions devoted to the training of teachers
so far as their number and distribution are concerned
but they are lacking in quality; others have training
schools very high in quality but they are poorly distributed
and insufficient in number.</p>

<p>The ideals and equipment of these special institutions
are factors of prime importance in determining
their real values. These center in the personnel of the
directing and teaching force. Too frequently thorough
scientific preparation for the specific work of supervising
and instructing in teachers' seminaries is wanting.
Natural endowment coupled with long, varied, and
successful experience has been regarded as sufficient
qualification. To be sure, native ability is an absolute
essential; experience is of immeasurable value;
but intensive scientific research in the fields of child
nature and development, psychology, and pedagogical
principles, together with scientific methods, are
equally indispensable.</p>

<p>Now it is a truism that teachers teach as they
have been taught. Hence, to achieve greatest results,
prospective teachers should secure their education
(general and professional) from ideal teachers as far
as possible and obtain experience through practice
teaching under the personal supervision of masters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
in education. Preparing under such conditions, their
natural capabilities would be brought more nearly to
maximum efficiency and they would become powers
for good in the profession. To have seminaries so
distributed and equipped that all prospective teachers
might have the best training within easy access would
be an ideal condition.</p>

<p>Germany affords an unparalleled example in the
development of teachers' seminaries. No other nation
ever had a system of training schools as efficient
as the one there provided. Her right to the title of
"School mistress of the world" is in large measure
traceable to the excellent training provided for and
required of the teachers in the schools.</p>

<p>Norway early recognized the importance of this
phase of school work and established six teachers'
seminaries. Subsequently four private seminaries have
been opened and the state has instituted the Pedagogical
Seminary in affiliation with the university in
Christiania. This gives them a liberal number of training
colleges well distributed. While they are subject
to some adverse criticism for failure to keep pace
with the development of their school system as a
whole, we must admit that the excellent results achieved
by the schools of Norway are due largely to the early
provision of these seminaries and insistence upon special
training for teaching positions.</p>

<p>It is probable that certain normal schools of the
United States deserve the honors so far as ideals and
results are concerned even though we have accorded
first ranking in system to Germany. Our plan, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
is too individual in nature to accomplish greatest
good. We lack a centralized authority with power to
do things. We have practically no co-ordination between
state systems and no uniformity. Even in
certain states the several schools do not cooperate
or supplement each other as they should. The waste
occasioned by the looseness of our system is enormous.
Could we unify our resources, systematize our equipment,
and provide efficient direction along cooperative
lines of activity, the American schools would
advance by leaps and bounds such as have not been
known up to the present time in any nation.</p>

<p>A word is in place here with reference to the
process of obtaining professional preparation. One
of the best things to be gained by special training is
a professional attitude toward the work of teaching.
This cannot be attained by spasmodic effort but must
be grown into. It comes rather as a result of long-continued
study and application of principles than by
intensive training for a short while. Direct instruction
and experiment extended over a long period of
time affords opportunity for innumerable associations
and interrelations which no "hurry-up" process can
provide. When professional training and study along
the general lines of academic learning parallel each
other they become interwoven in such a way that
each contributes to the other, and simultaneously the
proper attitude with respect to educational processes
becomes a very real part of the student's life.</p>

<p>There are a number of important pedagogical
principles which should become ingrained in the life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
of the individual in order that he make a success in
the teaching profession. It is a generally conceded
and commonly practiced rule in education that to
thoroughly master any field of knowledge and really
get into its vital parts it is necessary to keep the mind
acting upon it, at least intermittently, through several
years of time. Principles acted and reacted upon,
viewed in this light and that, examined under a certain
condition and then another, and tested in various
ways may result very differently in one's life than
when given a hurried, even though intensive, examination.
They are certain in the one instance to sink
deep into the life of the individual while in the other
case they may or may not affect his behavior.</p>

<p>It seems, therefore, that if the excellent features
which now characterize Norway's Pedagogical Seminary
might be carried along through the whole or a
large part of the college course, or if the work of the
seminary might be supplemented by studies such as
principles of education, history of education, child
study, and psychology, carried along with the college
work the results would be more effectual&mdash;the preparation
for teaching more thorough. However, considering
the short time that has elapsed since the founding
of this Seminary, its work is of high order and its
ideals are praiseworthy. The expressed intent of the
director is to develop the field as rapidly as possible
until it shall be characterized by the best means of
professional training known to the science.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>


<h4>THE TEACHERS' LIFE</h4>

<p>The life of the teacher is one of service,
calling for an expenditure of the self to an extent
perhaps greater than any other profession.
Among the Norse, however, it is not as strenuous
as that experienced in American schools. The
Norwegian teachers have more time than we for recreation,
self-improvement, or any of the activities
opened up by leisure hours. Life generally is set at
a more moderate pace with the Norsemen than with
the rushing Americans, and the schoolmen enjoy the
attendant advantages along with those in other professions
or occupations.</p>

<p>While leisure among certain classes leads to idleness
and corruption, it has quite opposite results
among the better class of citizens. Windelband says
that "The cultured man is he who in his leisure does
not become a mere idler." The cultured men of the
past have in their leisure developed science, art, literature,
and philosophy. They have had reserve energy
after the performance of their regular labors to use
in fruitful, self-selected activities. There are always
innumerable avenues through any one of which an
earnest servant of the state may bring great gain to
its people.</p>

<p>There is no nobler profession than that devoted
to the development of youth; neither is there any
occupation which brings more satisfying recompenses.
The child is the most precious asset of the nation and
deserves the maximum service possible for teachers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
to render. To perform the most efficient service the
teacher should have health, vigor, and time for recreation
in addition to scholastic and professional qualifications.
When school authorities make conditions
conducive to these ends, the results will be of such
character that teachers, pupils, patrons, and community
will all obtain greater profits.</p>

<p>Where school activities are not overtaxing, the
teacher has opportunity to build up his physical being,
increase the buoyancy of his spirits so as to enthuse
his pupils to a greater extent, or improve his educational
qualifications. One may concentrate his efforts
along some given line of research and from day to day
give the pupils under his tuition the benefits derived from
these specialized efforts. An individual by persistent
study may become the discoverer of new laws or
truths which reach the ends of the earth and profoundly
influence human affairs. Whatever the particular
activity, leisure consecrated to the uplift of
mankind is sure to result in great good.</p>

<p>When institutions drive their servants to the
limit of their powers they must inevitably be the
losers in the long run. They extinguish the light of
ambition, reduce to machines the individuals who
should be contributors to human progress, and make
legion "the man with the hoe." Such practice in
our schools results in waste of energy, depletion of
our teaching force, and irretrievable loss in many ways.</p>

<p>It is my candid opinion that the rapidity of the
evolution of the Norwegian school system, its excellencies,
and the highly satisfactory results coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
from it are in large measure due to the fact that it
does not overtax the powers of its teachers and educational
leaders, but on the contrary allows them
opportunity for the exercise of initiative and encourages
a professional attitude towards their work.</p>


<h4>THE CURRICULUM</h4>

<p>The course of instruction in the primary
and secondary schools of Norway is uniform
for all pupils except in the second and third
years of the gymnasium where diverse lines of study
are offered. The arrangement is unfortunate in that
the individual is sometimes required to pursue subjects
of study for which he has no adaptability and in
which he can develop no interest. Teachers in Norway
tell me that this requirement is a great handicap;
retarding the progress of the class, demoralizing the
individual, and increasing the burden of the teacher.
More flexibility in this regard would doubtless be an
advantage. The elective system, so common in our
own schools, when rightly supervised preserves sufficient
coherence between the studies taken up and gives
opportunity for more perfect adjustment.</p>

<p>Not only in the course of study but also in organization,
plans of instruction, and equipment, the schools
of Norway are too uniform to result in the freest development
of the intellect, the richest growth of individuality,
or the greatest conservation of time, energy,
or money. There are a few variations from their
regular routine but these are not sufficiently numerous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>One favorable innovation is the promotion of
teachers along with classes through a part or all of
the primary school. The consensus of opinion seems
to be that better results accrue when a teacher continues
with a class through several years of work.
This plan is generally followed unless the special fitness
of a teacher for work within particular limits
renders it highly advisable for assignment to be made
to such place. While special aptness for a particular
class of instruction should be recognized, the promoting
of teachers along with classes generally obviates
any tendency to staleness and usually emphasizes
special qualifications.</p>

<p>While it would be interesting to discuss the methods
used in presenting each subject in the curriculum
a few must suffice.</p>


<h4><i>Religious Instruction and Moral Education</i></h4>

<p>The church was first to establish schools in Norway,
putting them into operation in connection with
their cathedrals, probably about the middle of the
twelfth century. The chief aim was to prepare the
pupils for a religious life, either as ministers or as
faithful disciples. Having these as definite ends,
the materials for study were selected because of their
fitness to contribute along these lines. Instruction
was almost wholly in religion. Since morality is such
a fundamental part of religion, moral education in
large amount was given indirectly. The aim was
religion and the result was both morality and religion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Schools came to be generally regarded as institutions
wherein moral and religious instruction were
the prevailing if not the dominating features. This
phase of work early became traditional and gained
such momentum that it has ever formed a conspicuous
part of every grade of instruction throughout
the primary and secondary schools.</p>

<p>During the formative period the instruction in
religion maintained a vitality which was quite in keeping
with the demands of the times. However, as the
school system developed, especially during the closing
half of the last century, it became necessary to
arrange more definite plans of instruction in religion
as well as in other subjects in the school curriculum.
The adapting of instruction to the various grades of
school work was a difficult task. The adjustment
made to needs in the primary schools seems a very
happy one. In this elementary section of the school
system the instruction in religion consists mainly in
story telling. The work is made concrete and personal,
and its influence is most excellent.</p>

<p>Not so fortunate has been the attempt to present
the great truths and ideals of religion in the
secondary grades. The human appeal, so fruitful
in the lower classes, does not appear in the higher, at
least to the same degree. Instead the work is formal
and prescribed. Interest dies out and even respect
for the work rapidly wanes as the pupil passes into
more advanced grades. I have often thought while
observing the listlessness of the pupils during the period
for religious teaching that the effects upon morals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
and religion would be better by far without the instruction
as now provided.</p>

<p>To find lodgment in the heart and expression in
the experiences of youth, religious principles must be
made to appear practical and vital. They must be
shown to be desirable in themselves and in their
ends.</p>

<p>To teach religion successfully one must be a living
example of its true values, an earnest interpreter
of its meaning and power, and a sympathetic friend
of the pupils. Besides this he must be a genuine
teacher with a knowledge of youth and ability to
help others obtain a clear conception of the beauty
and worth of the nobler life.</p>

<p>Religion and morality are so intimately bound
up with life's activities that it is difficult to consider
them in and of themselves. It is quite impossible to
curriculize and present them as subjects for study
and instruction without building up in consciousness
the idea that they may or may not be phases of life.
When this is attempted it is liable to diminish rather
than to increase their true meaning.</p>

<p>It is at least possible that the most favorable
results come through specific occasions which arise
apart from set requirements. A genuine experience
in real life is the best illustration of what morality
and religion mean, and it furnishes the most secure
foundation for instruction along these lines.</p>

<p>Few lessons and no subjects of instruction can
be fully presented without giving considerable attention
to their moral and religious phases. If a lesson is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
completely mastered its moral and religious contributions
will have been taken over and appropriated
along with any and all other contents. When the
moral and religious values inherent in school studies
receive their proportionate emphasis there will be no
crying need of arranging special courses for their
study. The seriousness of the situation at present
lies not in the fact that there are no special courses
of instruction in morality and religion, but rather in
the condition that teachers fail to recognize their
opportunities for giving such instruction. They should
impress the children with the fact that morality and
religion are component parts of life and that they
give meaning and reality to every human experience.
While it would be gratifying to see these subjects
taught as separate branches by individuals who
could make them profitable, it is much more imperative
that all teachers recognize their own responsibility
in this regard, whatever subjects they have
to teach.</p>


<h4><i>The Classics</i></h4>

<p>In common with those of many other
countries, the school curricula of Norway have
been saturated with the classics. For a long
time the secondary schools were devoted largely to
the presentation of the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin
languages. About 1850, there arose a demand for an
education which was more utilitarian. Nature study,
the sciences, manual training, modern foreign languages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
and home economics pressed their claims for recognition
and the people became convinced of their values.
The masses then began to investigate what right
the languages of the ancients had for occupying so
large a proportion of attention in school work.</p>

<p>Gradually the ancient classics were replaced by
more modern educational materials. Hebrew and
Greek were in their turn dropped from the list of required
subjects and the time thus saved was given
to work regarded as more vital and beneficial. In
1896, a very decisive step was taken when by legislative
enactment Latin&mdash;the last of the dead languages&mdash;was
omitted from the list of subjects required
in the school curriculum.</p>

<p>This act of the Storthing has been severely criticised
by some. However, the people whose right and
duty it was to decide studied the matter carefully
and thoroughly at home and abroad, and after calm
consideration, acted in harmony with their best judgment,
passed the law, and put in into immediate execution.
The momentum of former practices, the force
of tradition, or the example of other nations was not
sufficient to control the Norwegian state in its action.
It does not permit precedent to determine its policies,
foreign nations to do its thinking, nor "well-enough"
systems to prevent reform.</p>

<p>When higher ground is seen clearly Norway
moves forward with all its power, determined to occupy
and utilize the greater opportunities. Such was
the condition of the state in its consideration of the
classics in their school curriculum. They were willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
that those individuals who might elect to pursue the
study of the ancient languages should have the privilege
to do so and they provided for them such opportunity.
However, they were definitely convinced that
to require all pupils to study these subjects in order
to complete courses of study or enter the university
was an injustice. To their credit be it said that when
they are convinced that a certain course of procedure
is best they have the moral courage to pursue
it. In this particular instance the people were fully
aware of the fact that they were taking a step which
was a decided deviation from the straightforward
course pursued for centuries by the leading national
educational systems. Yet they became converted to
the idea that for their own good, under their own
conditions, and looking forward to their future as a
state and nation, it would be the wiser solution to
leave the classics behind and devote more time and
energy to studies which they conceived to be more
efficacious.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note the recent tendencies
in this direction in other countries. In the United
States Latin is becoming less and less a required subject
of instruction in the high schools, and each year
lengthens the list of colleges which do not require it
for entrance. Even conservative and classic-loving
Germany has recently opened the doors of her universities
to those who have finished the Real-gymnasia.
Thus they, too, acknowledge that the way
of the classics is not the only road to higher culture
and learning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>It has come to be almost universally recognized
that the schools exist for the learner rather than the
learner for the schools. To debar an individual from
privileges for which he is prepared simply because he
has not met certain inherited traditional prescriptions
is rapidly becoming unorthodox. Norway seems
to have set the pace for other nations in at least this
one respect, and her clearsighted move in displacing
the classics by the introduction of larger amounts
of modern foreign languages and other branches of
greatest present utility is being followed by other
nations of sound pedagogical principles.</p>


<h4><i>Physical Culture</i></h4>

<p>Few are the instances where the physical
development of the children is so effectually provided
for as among the Norwegians. Gymnastics
is a regular feature throughout the entire
course of study until the completion of the gymnasium.
In addition to this the universal rule of requiring
the pupils to go into the open air during the intermissions
which follow every class meeting has its good
effects. Athletic sports also have recently become
more important features of school life. Fortunately
they have not reached a point of specialization where
their values are open to question.</p>

<p>Buildings and grounds are constructed and laid
out with the physical welfare of children in mind. As
a consequence we find gymnastic halls well equipped
and grounds supplied with the advantages most essential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
in the accomplishment of the desired end, viz.,
a strong and vigorous body in which to develop a
sound mind. Their school grounds are small, making
a crowded condition the rule in the larger schools.
Strange as it may seem, the same unfortunate condition
prevails almost universally in our own land
where there appears to be little excuse for congestion.
However, the size of the grounds is perhaps a matter
of minor importance, especially when compared to
their use. Space and equipment may be regarded
as incidental; use is the all-important part. Our
grounds are not used. We rarely have but one, if
any, intermission except the noon hour, the greater
portion of which is occupied in going for the midday
meal. The results of the Norwegians' enforced, frequent,
and regular use of the playgrounds are in
evidence on every hand. Robust, vigorous, buoyant,
active, healthy, sound, alert, and the like adjectives
are the appropriate ones to use in speaking of the
physiques of their pupils.</p>

<p>Were the influences of bodily conditions upon
mental growth and activity fully appreciated, the
schools would doubtless make a sudden shift toward
providing adequately for physical education. Physical
development has been regarded with considerable
favor for some time, but it has usually been a secondary
affair when it should have been introduced as a
vital feature. Educational systems should provide for
the training and development of the physical as well
as the mental life. They are dependent upon each
other and are in fact two phases of the same life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
It is obviously wasteful to seek to develop the one
without regard to the other, or to attempt the cultivation
of one at the expense of the other.</p>


<h4><i>Vocal Music</i></h4>

<p>Music is among the most potent factors
in developing national spirit and loyalty. Plato
wrote: "Any musical innovation is full of danger
to the whole state, and ought to be prohibited.... When
modes of music change, the
fundamental laws of the state always change with
them."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Napoleon stated that if he might write the
nation's songs he cared not who might write its laws.
Music in the better forms has moved individuals and
nations to great accomplishments, and its efficacy is
generally recognized. As a means of education, however,
it receives far too little attention.</p>

<p>The quality of music sung in the schools of Norway
has some points of superiority. One feature in
making it a powerful contributor in developing loyal
and competent citizens is the use they make of the
best compositions from their own writers. Their
poets and musicians have furnished large amounts
of excellent productions. They sing of their heroes
and of their national ideals and achievements. The
spirit in their songs reflects the soul of their fatherland.
The influence upon the lives of the pupils
contributes to solidarity of the nation and to love
for its institutions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>Contrast this with the results of the rattle of rag-time
and jigs. Too much of our public school, Sunday
school, and church music has been of this order. Public
school music and education along this line are
matters deserving more attention than they receive.
Recent introduction into many schools of victrolas
with records of masterpieces produced by the leading
artists of the world point to a recognition of the educative
value of the better quality of selections. To
hear the same productions direct from the soul of the
artist would be many times as effectual as any mechanical
reproduction, but this is beyond the reach of
the masses. Present indications give assurance that
the near future will see music more nearly occupying
its legitimate place in our educational provisions.</p>


<h4>LINES OF INSTRUCTION IN THE GYMNASIUM</h4>

<p>In the second and third years of gymnasial
work three courses of study are open, viz., <i>Real</i>, <i>Language-History</i>,
and <i>Language-History with Latin</i>. Here
pupils get their first experience in electing the line
of work wherein their study shall center. This seems
a rather fortunate provision, for by this time likes
and dislikes for certain subjects of study, special
aptitudes along specific lines, and choice of life work
are coming into the foreground of consciousness. The
pupils' likes and aptitudes working together influence
their decisions concerning life's activities. Again the
disposition and nature of individuals render one line
of study more attractive and beneficial than either of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
the others. There are, indeed, many influences at
work upon pupils of such age which make it appear
highly advisable to follow some particular line of
study.</p>

<p>Whether pupils go into the chosen line of life
work directly from the gymnasium or by way of the
university, it is of distinct advantage to specialize
along the line for which they are preparing. Should
they intend to teach, they would doubtless prefer
studying most the subjects to be taught. In these
they would have deepest interest, and from their pursuit
they would derive greatest profit. If they determined
to study theology, law, medicine, or some
other special phase of learning, they would make selection
of gymnasial course with that object in view.
Whatever the work to follow completion of the gymnasium,
the different courses prepare for the narrower
specialization which characterizes life's activities and
all their university study.</p>

<p>The following table presents the exact work represented
by the three courses in form convenient for
comparisons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

comparison. It stresses the importance of several
modern languages and history, giving to them a preeminence
over all other work. The <i>Real</i> course reduces
the work in English, French, Norwegian, and
History and increases the amount of science and
mathematics. The course including Latin makes similar
reductions but emphasizes Latin instead of the
sciences and mathematics.</p>

<p>The Norwegians believe it better and cheaper to
offer the different courses in the same school than to
provide separate schools. This plan necessitates less
duplication and at the same time affords quite as
adequate facilities for whatever specialization the different
courses represent.</p>


<h4>CO-EDUCATION</h4>

<p>Whether schools should be co-educational has
been a live question among many nations for generations,
and considerable time will yet elapse before
unanimity of opinion is reached.</p>

<p>Nearly all the schools of Norway are co-educational.
However, in some of the city systems boys
and girls use different playgrounds, and in certain
schools they are segregated also for purposes of instruction.
These matters are governed according to
the wishes of the inspector or the desires of the principals
of the different schools. The aim is to combine
the better phases represented in various methods and
to adopt the plan best suited to the local situation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
or the one to which the person in charge is converted
and in which he can, because of his convictions, accomplish
best results.</p>

<p>"The separation of the sexes is complete in all
the schools of Germany excepting some of the primary
classes. The advisability of this is a large question,
but by no means a settled one.... Germany
feels that she has the proper solution, while in
America, with an opposite answer, we feel for the
most part satisfied."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>In American public schools co-education is almost
universally practiced. In reference to this matter
we give the opinions of some prominent educators.
The lamented Dr. Harris, while engaged in the
St. Louis, Mo., schools, wrote: "Discipline has improved
continually with the adoption of mixed schools;... the
mixing of the male and female departments
of a school has always been followed by improvement
in discipline, not merely on the part of the boys,
but on that of the girls as well. The rudeness and
abandon which prevail among boys when separate at
once give place to self-restraint in the presence of
girls. The prurient sentimentality engendered by
educating girls apart from boys... disappears
almost entirely in mixed schools."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The Honorable
John Eaton while Commissioner of Education of the
United States made report concerning the co-education
of the sexes in several hundred large and small cities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
in the Union. The tenor of the entire report is well
summarized in the following sentence: "We are created
male and female; all the impulses and activities
of nature enforce co-education; if we must live together
we must be educated to that end; to educate
separately is an attempt to change the natural order
of human economy."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>In our higher institutions of learning the situation
is much the same. The Commissioner of Education,
referring to the State University of Iowa,
writes, "The report of the president says that the
experience of the institution has uniformly been favorable
to the co-education of the sexes; that their
influence on each other in the acquisition of learning
has been most beneficial as well as conducive to orderly
habits. The presence of both sexes is considered 'an
invaluable feature' in restraining indecorum and an
'inducement to every virtue.'"<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The practice has
continued with similar results throughout the entire
country.</p>

<p>Instances favorable to co-education might be
multiplied. Its adoption has become a foregone conclusion
so far as our general system of education is
concerned. True we do have some colleges and a
few secondary schools devoting themselves exclusively
to the education of one or the other of the sexes. Not
many of them are state institutions. They are usually
private schools and they answer a certain demand
whether well founded or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>
<p>There are certain questions in connection with
the education of the sexes which are fundamental
and need considerable attention. However, no attempt
can be made here to solve the many important
problems suggested. It is the intent only to emphasize
the necessity of being awake to real conditions and to
indicate the fact that herein lies a field for the educator's
most careful consideration.</p>

<p>The questions arise: Are the natural functions
of man and woman enough alike to justify making
their education identical, and will the adoption of
such a plan of education result in the advancement
or deterioration of the race? A recent article referring
"to the endeavor to use women industrially, socially,
and politically on the same footing as men" sounds
a warning note, crying out against the present tendencies
which are taking from the flower of womankind
thousands who are eminently fitted for motherhood,
"woman's essential function on the globe," and
diverting their lives to other and less noble pursuits.
"It is therefore essential to the race," say the authors,
"that the ablest, healthiest, and finest women should
be encouraged, tempted, compelled, if necessary, by
circumstances to devote themselves to family life by
becoming wives and mothers, and it is doubtful how
far it is expedient to draw them off, even for a time to
other occupations."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>While co-education is in agreement with conditions
of family life, is economic, and continues to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
entirely practicable, the question still remains whether
there may not be justification in a demand for certain
fundamental differences to be made in adapting educational
means and matter to the two sexes. Co-education,
however, may continue without making the
education of the sexes identical. In fact it is very
easily possible to make the education of the sexes
fundamentally different even though both institutions
and class activities are co-educational in practice.
A difference in the amount of work in certain groups
of subjects required of men and women, respectively,
might furnish a satisfying solution of this question.
And if there are certain branches of study which should
belong exclusively to one or the other of the sexes,
it is a simple matter to separate for such work. On
the whole it seems to the writer highly advisable to
educate the sexes together as far as possible.</p>


<h4>THE SCHOOL YEAR</h4>

<p>The regular school year in Norway has forty
weeks of six days each. The plan of having school
on Saturdays furnishes an additional day of fruitful,
well directed activity to the children, who might otherwise
be permitted to spend the time in idleness or
misguided conduct.</p>

<p>In America we have so many vacations and holidays
that our schools are in session only about 75 or
80 per cent of the time utilized in Norway. We may
be justified in having the long summer vacations
because of the inconvenience and depletion of strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
occasioned by the heat, but several of our vacations
during the year and the practice of having no school
on Saturdays are inheritances without much justification.
School activities, when rightly conducted,
should be invigorating and exhilarating instead of
producing a state of prolonged fatigue requiring seasons
of inactivity or other changes in order to regain
lost vitality. Again, the relaxation occasioned by
diversion of thought and change of activity on Sunday
is certainly sufficient to counteract any necessity of
using Saturday for recuperation. It appears evident
that we are not as frugal in this matter as sound judgment
demands that we should be.</p>


<h4>SCHOOL LUNCHES</h4>

<p>It has been found that mental activity is
very greatly affected by conditions of nutrition.
The quality, quantity, and preparation of foods,
together with regularity in eating, determine to
a considerable extent what may be the progress of
the pupil in his growth, both mental and physical.
The child who is improperly fed or underfed is thereby
handicapped, while the one who receives intelligent
care along the same line is placed at a distinct
advantage.</p>

<p>That in all large cities there are hundreds and
thousands of underfed children is a fact of common
knowledge. In many cities provisions have been made
for supplying at least one meal per day free of charge
to all needy pupils. Norway has been in the forefront<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
in this paternalistic movement. Several of her cities
have undertaken this noble work and probably no
city in the world can boast of more adequate facilities
for carrying it on than Christiania.</p>

<p>They purchase the best procurable quality of the
most nutritious food, prepare it in a wholesome and
palatable manner, and send it out from a central
kitchen to the several primary schools of the city in
such quantities as are needed to liberally supply the
demands. The food is served hot in the regular lunch
rooms absolutely free to all children whose parents ask
it and at first cost to others. This work in Christiania
is typical of the provisions made in other cities but
the equipment, and possibly the system of distribution,
is superior to that found elsewhere.</p>

<p>In addition to this, nutritious and easily digested
foods and drinks are provided at other schools and
served at a moderate cost in the lunch rooms at stated
hours in the day. This latter provision is generally
in charge of the family of the janitor of the building
and is most common in the private and secondary
schools to which the previously mentioned plan does
not extend.</p>

<p>Experiment has demonstrated in our own land
that it is entirely practicable to provide at a minimum
cost warm, well-cooked, wholesome foods to either
supplement or replace the cold indigestible lunches
so commonly carried by school children. The cities
and towns enjoy few if any advantages over the rural
districts in this regard. The plan is workable and
advisable, and it should be more commonly adopted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>


<h4>COMPARATIVE ATTAINMENTS</h4>

<p>In the study of the school system of
Norway it is interesting to compare the school
life and attainments of the pupils with those
of American children. It is true that until we
have established norms for measuring the results
of education, we cannot make accurate statements
regarding the relative standing of pupils nor estimate
precisely their accomplishments. However, we are
able to single out some features of importance and
compare them in a general way.</p>

<p>It has been noted that the Norwegian pupils
begin school at seven years of age, while the American
children commence at five or six. Many prominent
educators believe that our American children start
to school too young. They are of the opinion that
their development, physical and mental, would be
better if they did not begin formal school work until
at least seven or eight years of age. The greater physical
development of the Norwegians, due to their later
start, gives them a distinct advantage. Their bodily
strength and vigor supplement and aid their mental
growth.</p>

<p>Passing through Norway's successive grades of
school to the completion of the gymnasium requires
twelve years. The same length of time is used in
reaching graduation from our American high school.
Now it is generally conceded that a graduate of the
gymnasium in Norway is two years in advance of a
graduate of the American high school; or in other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
words a student entering the university from Norway's
gymnasial course has an education equivalent
to that of an individual entering the junior year of
work in an American college or university. Some
would rank the Norwegian even higher than I have
here suggested; however, only a very general comparison
can be made.</p>

<p>In consideration of these conditions the question
arises: How shall we account for the fact that we
use two extra years in order to reach approximately
the same standard? It is recalled that the Norwegian
entering school at seven and progressing at the normal
rate are ready for university work at nineteen while
the Americans begin two years earlier in order to reach
the same attainments at the same age. If the Norwegian
pupils accomplish as much in twelve years,
beginning at seven years of age, as our American children
do in fourteen years, commencing at five, should
we rest satisfied, or should we modify our system
so as to profit by their experience? Why permit
traditions or precedent to rob us of choice benefits
within our reach?</p>

<p>Again, the students entering the Norwegian university
are older and more mature both physically
and mentally than are ours. Being older, their habits
of life are more definitely formed, and they are better
fitted to undertake the responsibility of self-direction.
It has been suggested by some that we extend the work
of the high school in order to keep our children under
parental guidance until they are sufficiently mature
to care for themselves at less hazard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>The course pursued by Norwegian pupils is uniform
for all until the last two years of the secondary
school, when certain branches of study may be chosen
for major attention. When students start to the university
they enter immediately upon specialized lines
of work and pursue them to their limits. The American
pupils are privileged to elect a considerable proportion
of their secondary school work, yet they do
not generally specialize at all until their junior year in
college; frequently they postpone definite specialization
until the beginning of graduate courses.</p>

<p>Fundamental social characteristics enter into
educational ideals, and each nation, very naturally,
develops a system of schools peculiarly adapted to
its needs. There are, of course, general underlying
principles which operate in all educational systems
and place them on similar bases; there are also certain
features, essential in the make-up of the individual
systems, which are not common. These peculiar
factors give distinctive character to the various systems
and are of telling effect in determining their
excellencies. Whether these special phases affect the
life and accomplishments of the pupils, the nature of
their work, the management of school affairs, or other
educational activities; they render the different systems
almost impossible of comparison. However, they are
suggestive, and frequently they may be modified and
used in improving the systems of other countries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>


<h4>METHODS OF INSTRUCTION</h4>

<p>Every successful teacher presents his subject in conformity
with some universal principles of method. While
these cannot be mechanically systematized and used
according to unchanging rules, they form a necessary
part of an instructor's equipment. The teacher
who knows the subject and is master of the technique
of instruction is sure of success, while the one without
method will fail.</p>

<p>It seems that the pedagogues of Norway have
formed a happy combination of some methods of
instruction. They appreciate the value of the class
meeting and with them "teaching goes on chiefly in
what we call the <i>recitation</i>. This is the teacher's point
of contact with his pupils; here he meets them face to
face and mind to mind; here he succeeds or fails in
his function of teaching."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>The excellence of the work of instruction in Germany
has long been recognized. That "the German
teacher teaches" is very generally known. He transcends
all texts and is an authority on the subjects
he presents. By pedagogic training he has been
exalted to a place of eminence in his profession. It
is possible that they over-emphasize the work of the
instructor and neglect the part that pupils should
play.</p>

<p>In America various methods of instruction are
in use. One plan is to regard teacher and pupils as
cooperators in activities wherein interests are common.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
The teacher, having had experience, exercises control
and serves as chief guide through the most critical
places in the way of progress. So far as possible the
pupils are encouraged to exercise individual initiative
and to become independent. They are not to be
merely recipients from the teacher's vast store of
knowledge, but with him they are to become genuine
participators in the world's thoughts and activities.</p>

<p>Another plan in all too common use may be
designated as the "text book method." According
to it the major portion of information comes from the
voluminous, logically developed, well-arranged, and
somewhat attractively printed and bound readable
text. The function of the teacher is largely testing
knowledge gained from books, assigning lessons in
the text, supplementing the work of the pupils from
his own store or by reference to other works on the
subject, and stimulating them to earnest effort in
every possible way.</p>

<p>President Hall would not regard this text book
plan of work as very worthy procedure. He writes
that some teachers take time "telling pupils what to
do and testing to see if they have done it. But this
is not teaching; but a device of ignorance, laziness, or
physical weakness, or all combined. The real teacher
teaches and reduces recitation to a minimum. Whoever
has visited the best continental schools or studied
comparatively such national educational exhibitions
as those of St. Louis must have been acutely impressed
with the fact that we exhibit what the pupil does,
Europe what the teacher does. Here he says, 'Go,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
do this, and prove to me that you have done it.'
There he says, 'Come, let us study together; I know
and will inform, interest and inspire you to go on.'"<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The instructors in the schools of Norway are true
teachers but they do not rely wholly upon their own
activity. The text finds a place not so large as in
American schools but of some consequence. The pupils
are privileged to act on their own initiative to some
extent though they are not granted unlimited freedom.
They cooperate with the teachers in many lines of
school work where they find interest and profit. Demonstration
is largely in the hands of the teachers.
The testing of lessons studied is a common exercise
with them, and their class hours are given to intensive
activity in which every individual member is expected
to be a participant and contributor. They, like we
in America, aim to suit instruction to pupils of average
ability rather than to the brightest as they do in Germany
and France.</p>


<h4>CONTINUITY OF EFFORT</h4>

<p>By referring to the programs of work arranged
for the successive years in the schools of Norway, one
readily sees that there is but little variation in subjects
of study from the first grades of the primary
school to the completion of the gymnasium. The
change of greatest importance is the introduction
of foreign languages&mdash;German and English the first
and second years in the middle schools and French the
first year in the gymnasium.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>
<p>When the child enters school he begins subjects
of study which represent the several fields of knowledge.
The teaching aims to keep him in touch with
these in ways adapted to his stage of development.
As the pupil grows the scope of each subject enlarges.
They advance together. Keeping the subject definitely
in mind for a long time tends to the creation of permanent
interests and at the same time makes possible
its assimilation into the very life of the learner. It
becomes vital and usable after being acted upon in
the various stages and conditions of life through which
the child passes. Inter-relations and associations with
other subjects of study and various phases of life are
affected, which give to it distinct values. Too often
we find in our own schools that hurried and intensive
study of certain subjects does not create permanent
interests nor prove of real worth.</p>

<p>If natural forces in the child are recognized and
utilized they facilitate the learning process and make
school activities profitable and delightful. It is a well
attested fact that at certain periods in the psychological
development of a child mastery of special phases
of learning is easy for him. Courses of study and
plans of instruction should be prepared in such a way
that the different phases of work included may be
presented and stressed while the nascent period of
interest is on.</p>

<p>We Americans are given to dividing a subject
into its separate phases, studying them consecutively
for short periods of time, and then forgetting them.
The plan is wasteful and unpedagogic. Note the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
manner in which we break up the work in mathematics
and in the mother tongue. It is questionable whether
there be a single valid argument favoring such practice.</p>

<p>The Norwegians present mathematics as a single
and comprehensive subject. The same is true in their
teaching of the mother tongue. The plan is advantageous
from every view point. It is certainly conducive
to economy of time and efficient results.
Instead of breaking up subjects of instruction and
isolating their several phases from each other, we
ought rather to keep them intact and set about
coordinating the several branches of instruction as
closely as possible.</p>

<p>Education should seek to associate and interrelate
the truths we obtain and to organize our knowledge
into an effectual system. The formation of a
comprehensive curriculum, with arrangements for its
presentation in harmony with sound psychological
and pedagogical principles, is a matter of pressing
importance.</p>

<p>While the school systems of the present are evidently
superior to what any past generation has
known, yet the investigations of psychologists and
educationists stress the fact that in many ways they
are weak and inefficient. The accumulated experience
of the past needs overhauling by masters with
insight and foresight. Educational methods and principles
which have been tested and proven worthy
should be put into operation. Each nation should
devise and adopt the most perfect educational system
possible, and this then should be carried into execution
by an army of qualified teachers responsive to
the call for truly consecrated service.</p>
